    <p>Posted on Tue 27 June 2017 in <a href="./category/review.html">Review</a></p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve always enjoyed reading delayed reviews from people, so I thought I&#8217;d put my own together. I&#8217;ve had the giant iPad Pro for about a year now, and I thought I would go over how it&#8217;s been using it as my only computing device. For reference point, I have a 2011 MacBook Air that I was looking to replace. I was waiting for the new MacBook pros to come out and needed something to tide me over until&nbsp;then. </p>
<p>The main thing that drew me in was the pencil for note taking. I&#8217;ve been looking for the perfect combination of digital and analog (read: all the <a href="https://www.livescribe.com">livescribe pens</a>) and trying it out in the store is what sold me. I ended up getting the 128 gb with no cellular connection. Because I was majoring in Computer Science, this had have enough memory to handle anything I threw at&nbsp;it. </p>
<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>My two entry requirements were the Smart Keyboard and the Apple Pencil, and I used those exclusively until this week. I recently invested in a Bluetooth keyboard as well as an iPad stand which improves my setup from an ergonomics perspective. I do most of my writing in Ulysses, journal in Day One, program in Pythonista and use Airmail for email. Instapaper is my read it later service of choice, and I use Tweetbot for twitter. Dropbox links everything together. Finally, OneNote is my note taking app of&nbsp;choice. </p>
<h1>Overall&nbsp;Thoughts</h1>
<p>To be honest, the whole thing works much better than I thought it would. I&#8217;ll break down some points in more detail below, but I am at roughly 90% task parity as opposed to a computer. The only times I need to break out the laptop are for programming (looking at you&nbsp;R/Stata). </p>
<p>The two giant positives for me are taking notes and the lack of overhead. Taking notes on the iPad Pro is the One True Way. The infinite canvas, ability to change pen colors and thickness as well as highlight is truly a game changer. I used to be a black pen and paper person, and I will never go&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>And then I never thought I would be this person, but the lack of overhead with an iPad Pro is freeing. No need to worry about files, extensions, or any of the nonsense. It all (and trust me, I&#8217;m slightly gagging when I say this) just&nbsp;works. </p>
<p>The few areas where it can improve are in an ergonomic fashion (the thing is a beast, but the stand and Bluetooth keyboard combo should help with that). I would love to be able to plug this into a giant monitor, but I have no idea how that would even work (and it would also be a distaste ergonomically). In addition,  I would love to do the last 10% of my work on this. R on this thing would be&nbsp;fantastic. </p>
<p>I will say that if I was a big gamer on steam, this would obviously not be tenable. <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Playing Vainglory in 12.9 inches of glory is a fantastic experience. If gaming really is your thing, maybe you should consider an investment in a controller (I hear great things about this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Stratus-Wireless-Gaming-Controller/dp/B00HSB2EZI">one</a>).</p>
<p>One complaint that I don&#8217;t understand is that Apple should make a custom software for iPad, or even put MacOS on it. I am here to report back and say that not only would such a combination be unwieldy, I would actually be against it. Unless if you have a giant steam library or a specific app keeping you on an x86 system, the switch to an iPad can absolutely be&nbsp;made. </p>
<p>I guess to finish up, I didn&#8217;t think it would go this well. I want to give a special shoutout to Pythonista (if you&#8217;re into coding at all, definitely it check out with StaSh). It&#8217;s such a pleasure to just open an app and have a compete <span class="caps">IDE</span>. Overall, I am looking forward to my iPad only&nbsp;lifestyle. </p>
