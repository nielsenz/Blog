Summary: How to apply MongoDB to a real problem.


While experimenting with and researching the Twitter API [^1] I came across [this excellent article](http://pythondata.com/collecting-storing-tweets-with-python-and-mongodb/) on how to save tweets to a Mongo database on your local machine. While definitely overkill for what I had planned, it is awesome! I love seeing programming projects from people across the world and this shows an  excellent use case for a server as well.  

[^1]:	I use Tweetpy, which is fantastic.
