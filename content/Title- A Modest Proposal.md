Summary: All the fun of hockey, but without the fighting.  

For a Thanksgiving themed post, I'd like to talk about the NFL's [ratings problem.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/sports/football/monday-night-football-tv-ratings-espn.html?_r=0) Ratings for the NFL are down across the board, and there have been several potential causes mentioned in the punditry surrounding the issue. Primarily, there are several terrible teams this season and a lack of an apparent super team. In addition, there may be too many games of football being played, resulting in football apathy[^1]. Finally, the concussion problem being ever present may also be a concern to some viewers. 

I have heard many solutions about how to fix this dilemma. Some of these solutions include removing the Thursday Night games completely, focus on streaming the games to millennials as well as implementing rule changes to make the game more palpable to watch. Though these solutions would no doubt benefit the game, I would like to add my own solution. My idea is simple yet effective: simply take away a quarter of play. This would make the format of the game similar to hockey, in that there would be three periods with two "halftime" breaks separating each period. This approach has several benefits that would make the game more interesting, increasing ratings across the board.

In an NFL football game, endings are simply the most notable part of the game. Play during the middle five minutes are often forgettable. On the other hand, play during the last five minutes of each half are often remarkable. This is due to the increased pace of play as teams try and beat the clock. This hurry up offense is when football is at it's most entertaining. Teams are at their best, slinging the ball far downfield in order to try and gain an advantage before the break. As a viewer, these are the parts of the game I remember the most, and my plan puts the focus on the more interesting parts. 

The best part about my plan is that there is no decline in ad revenue. I would suggest against adding more time to the three periods as the whole goal is to reduce football fatigue. Instead, the ad revenue could be made up during the extra break between periods. This would give more time for analysis and the commercials could fit in here, keeping ad revenue the same.
   
With my plan, there are several benefits and zero costs present[^2]. Football often goes on too long, and shortening the game would make it more palpable for viewers across the globe. The extra break would result in an increase of the hurry up offense, further increasing the highlight potential of the sport as well. Finally, the extra "half time" between periods would make up the ad revenue and increase the studio analysis, lowering the fixed costs of those studios. This holiday season, let's remember to give thanks and make football more interesting to watch.

[^2]:	Although I am easily not a scientist, it would not surprise me that having more time to rest between periods would lower the concussion rate of football players, besides the fact that they are playing less.
