Summary: Apple’s pricing is taking a surprising turn.

On this blog I talk a lot about how to price goods. In this vein, I came across [this article](https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2017/3/15/the-curious-state-of-apple-product-pricing) from the fantastic [Above Avalon](https://www.aboveavalon.com) about how Apple is pricing two of their more recent goods. As Cybart writes:
> As Apple pushes deeper into luxury brand territory, the company is making its products more accessible through lower pricing. At $159, Apple is underpricing AirPods. The same can be said for Apple Watch, priced at $269. In just ten years, we have moved from the "Apple Tax" days, when Apple was accused of pricing products artificially high, to Apple products being priced below the competition. Apple is using its balance sheet and scale to grab new users, and in the process, redefine luxury.  

Overall, excellent analysis and a great example of what pricing looks like in the real world.
