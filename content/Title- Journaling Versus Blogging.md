Summary: In a world of weakening privacy, is there value to posting things publicly?

I have been trying to make a stronger distinction between a private journal versus a public blog. As an example, I have been enjoying [With the Grainâ€™s](https://with.thegra.in) small discussion on a personal topic per day. This combination of public and private is useful to read; hearing what other people are going through helps put my own life in perspective. With November being the month of [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org), I plan on writing more and seeing what results from that.
