Summary: Background 

Ex-academic, current Pricing Analyst. Interested in using data to discover the truth.  

Before entering the working world, I received a Master’s in Applied Economics from Northeastern University. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor of Arts from UNLV in Computer Science and Economics. 

I'm interesting in using economics to make better business decisions. I’m also using Python, R, SQL, and Tableau for data analytics. I'm a student of the market who knows how to use computers. 

We’re entering a very exciting time. Data collection and machine learning will lead to society advancing at a faster and faster rate; I intend to be documenting that progress. 

Otherwise, I enjoy Apple products, books, and making Web Apps with Flask. These topics will influence my writing, from shorter Tech Tips to deeper analysis and How To guides.
