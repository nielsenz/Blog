Summary: 10 Rapid facts about programming with python.

1. I’m not sure if I will ever remember the colon after the if statement condition. 
2. Same for the for statement 
3. openpyxl is great for manipulating for excel spreadsheets
4. (Except if you want to read from one workbook and write to another).
5. Writing to a pandas data frame is a delightful intermediate step!
6. Always use the concat method for merging two data frames 
7. To get rid of the first n rows of a data frame, one can drop said rows via the drop head(x) command.
8. Which is super useful when the first row used to initialize the data frame is utter gibberish. 
9. Debugging a program is somewhat like [playing a piano](https://twitter.com/Niels506/status/859946189554421766)
10. Sleep is key. No problems were ever solved at midnight (or 1, 2…)

There’s going to be a full writeup on my python code coming soon. It definitely felt good to get back into the programming swing of things now that the semester is over. Nothing like an interesting data source to prompt a sense of discovery!
