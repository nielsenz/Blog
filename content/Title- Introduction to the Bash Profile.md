Summary: Just started programming? Confused by the terminal? Baffled by bash? This will definitely help clear things up. 

As part of every tech blog, it’s crucial to have a post regarding bash. For those of you who don’t know what bash is, it’s a document that customizes the terminal[^1]. This can be writing your own commands that combine multiple commands, shortening other commands, changing colors, etc. To open up the bash profile, type the following code.
	cd ~
	sudo nano .bash_profile
	//Make changes
	source ~/.bash_profile //resets terminal

I’m just getting starting with frequent terminal usage, so my bash profile isn’t huge. The one command that I found online is a command brewup which updates Homebrew[^2].  I also found some file searching commands online which are super handy. Next on my add list are commands that make hidden files visible and visa versa. The terminal is an incredibly useful tool, and the bash profile makes it even more useful! So go forth and customize!
