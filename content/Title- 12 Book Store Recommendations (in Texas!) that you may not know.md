Terrific twitter follow [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com) recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/austinkleon/status/997994423794454529) some bookstore recommendations that I wanted to record here for posterity. [^1] Below are Kleon’s book recommendations:

1. The Austin Public Library (which truly looks gorgeous)
2. BookPeople 
3. Ransom Center and Michener Center at UT
4. Half Price Books
5. Soco Books
6. Balcones Books
7. Malvern Books (Kleon: “great poetry, small press and NYRB collection.””
8. Book Woman Austin
9. Monkey Wrench ATX
10. Kinokuniya
11. Recycled Reads
12. Three Barnes and Nobels

Overall, a pretty serious collection! I look forward to visiting these stores whenever I’m in the Austin area.
