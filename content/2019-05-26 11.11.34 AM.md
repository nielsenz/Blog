The hardest (and most boring!) part of any code is the initial work it takes to learn something - solving the first problem allows you to move on to solving more interesting problems. 

With regards to coding, I’ve found that it’s good to have some boilerplate code to solve common problems: I won't remember how to find duplicates off the top of my head, so having code to refer back to is super useful. 

##  Finding Dups 
`Select name, count(*) from ACTUAL_TABLE`
`Group by name`
`Having Count(*) > 1`

## Creating a Temp Table
`If Object_ID(‘Tempdb..#Tempb’, ’U’) IS NOT NULL`
`Drop table #tempb; — Select * From #tempb`
`Select`
	 `[customerID]`
	`,[AgeBin] = case when [Age] < 40 then ‘40s’`
	`etc`
`Into #tempb`

## To convert to Month
`[month] = cast(Dateadd(MONTH,datediff(Month,0,[datefield]),0) AS DATE`

And then to get YOY, just join to that field again using the dateadd -1 or dateadd +1 Year trick

 `[currentThing] = v1.[blah]`
`,[LYThing] = v2.[blah]`
`FROM [Table] v1`
	`LEFT JOIN [Table]v2 on Conditions`
	`AND DATEADD(Year,v1.[Date],-1) = v2.[Date]`
