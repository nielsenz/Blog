    <h1 id="apple-moves-into-ar">Apple Moves into <span class="caps">AR</span></h1>
    <p>Posted on Mon 10 July 2017 in <a href="/category/analysis.html">Analysis</a></p>
  </header>
  <div>
    <p>One of the most intriguing announcements from <span class="caps">WWCD</span> came when Apple introduced it’s push into the <span class="caps">AR</span> realm, aptly called ARKit. From <a href="https://developer.apple.com/arkit/">Apple</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>iOS 11 introduces ARKit, a new framework that allows you to easily create unparalleled augmented reality experiences for iPhone and iPad. By blending digital objects and information with the environment around you, ARKit takes apps beyond the screen, freeing them to interact with the real world in entirely new&nbsp;ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question becomes why Apple would want to get into <span class="caps">AR</span>. Certainly Tim Cook has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/10/14581428/apple-tim-cook-ar-vr-product-reveal-interview">made mention</a> of <span class="caps">AR</span> being the next frontier, but it does seem like a strange strategy when <span class="caps">AR</span> consists of holding up a screen to look through. For those who don’t know what <span class="caps">AR</span> is, <span class="caps">AR</span> is augmented reality. Pokemon Go is probably the most popular example, but there are plenty of examples of <span class="caps">AR</span> becoming more and more prevalent.<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This is hardly a revolutionary thought, I think that Apple may be making <span class="caps">AR</span> glasses. This then reveals Apple&#8217;s strategy: they are trying to create content now to be able to benefit them them. One thing that this allows us to do is then skate to where the puck is going and figure out how we can benefit from the upcoming <span class="caps">AR</span> trend. Early on <span class="caps">AR</span> will be complementary; it is only later that entire new uses for <span class="caps">AR</span> will emerge. While less interesting, we can examine different value propositions for current apps and see how they can use the <span class="caps">AR</span> transformation to gain a competitive&nbsp;advantage. </p>
<p>For example, I would love to hold up a mapping application like Yelp and be able to see the reviews of businesses around me in real life. This is definitely the future  and would make wandering around the city much more&nbsp;interesting. </p>
<p><span class="caps">AR</span> could also be added to any app with a personal profile. I can be at a networking conference and be chatting with a fellow attendee, and have their LinkedIn information pop up. Same for Facebook, or even a dating profile like Tinder or Ok Cupid at a singles only&nbsp;event. </p>
<p>With <span class="caps">AR</span>, games are also much more immersive.  Tower Defense games become more engrossing if I can see the towers placed on my kitchen table. With a game like Minecraft, you will be able to build a monument while exploring your house. Similarly, any fighting games where you can see the characters appear and start to fight drags you into the&nbsp;action. </p>
<p>Overall, <span class="caps">AR</span> becomes an incredible value proposition for many types of apps, even in these early days of <span class="caps">AR</span> Kit. This will only benefit Apple as more and more apps integrate with <span class="caps">AR</span> Kit, giving them a massive content advantage when they release their <span class="caps">AR</span>&nbsp;glasses. </p>

<p>Some examples include the game Pokemon Go was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingress_(video_game)">based off of</a> as well as an app recently featured on Apple’s Planet of the Apps. Always tough when Apple puts you on a tv show and then Sherlocks your app. &#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
