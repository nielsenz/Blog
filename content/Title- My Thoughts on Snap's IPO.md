Summary: Predicting the future is tough. Predicting the future of a company via an income statement is tougher still.

With the IPO of Snap[^1] tomorrow, I thought it would be useful to examine both the Bull and Bear case.[^2] Snap has been a divisive company since the beginning, and never more so after the [S-1 filing document was released](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564408/000119312517029199/d270216ds1.htm). Below are a few bullet points for why the company could either succeed or fail. 

## Bull Case: 
- They have executed flawlessly so far. This post by Ben Thompson [^3] describing Snap's product strategy (termed [laddering up](https://stratechery.com/2016/snapchats-ladder/)) is worth reading in it's entirety. 
- I find that they currently have a majority of mindshare with the teen demographic. Much of communication that I see among teens in the United States happens over Snapchat. 
- The management team maintains all of the voting rights for Snapchat. If you think the CEO [Evan Spiegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Spiegel) is a product visionary, his control over Snapchat will not change after the IPO.  
- They're cool and continue to innovate.[^4]

## Bear Case
- The S-1 document shows that Snap has an increasing cost per customer, while revenue per consumer is mostly flat. This puts them in a bad position, making it difficult to turn a profit.
- Facebook is actively trying to crush Snap and has been for awhile. After a failed acquisition attempt, Facebook tried to [clone Snapchat](http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/17/5817996/facebook-slingshot-app-vs-snapchat) [twice](http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/9/5700732/facebook-poke-is-dead-and-so-is-facebook-camera). After those attempts failed, Instagram copied the story functionality from Snapchat wholesale, causing [Snapchat's growth to crater](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/slowchat/). 
- To add insult to injury, Facebook is now [testing similar functionality](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/25/facebook-stories/) in the Facebook App. 
- Snap's entire strategy is based on out maneuvering the competition. If Spiegal somehow misses a trend and someone else can capitalize, thatcould spell doom for the company. 

There is no wrong choice here. On one hand, Spiegal is a one of a kind product visionary and it makes sense to believe that he and Snap will continue to succeed. However, Snap is facing a challenge with Facebook's blatant duplication of Snapchat's core features. No matter what happens, it will be interesting to see if Snap can succeed or if market forces sink the company.
