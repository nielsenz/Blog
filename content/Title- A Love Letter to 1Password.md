Summary: And it's not even Valentine's Day. 

Before 1Password, my life was a security nightmare. Darkness ruled: I had the same password and email for every account that I created. This lead to me having multiple accounts that were easily hackable. My online presence was maintained by a thread. 

And then one day light descended down on me: I was introduced to 1Password. The application itself is a game changer. It made unique, secure passwords easy instead of impossible. I wasn't forced to memorize some variation of a weak password after making an account and my use of the "forget password" link decreased tremendously.

To conclude, If you have someone in your life who struggles to remember passwords, please give them the gift of this application. It will help their lives tremendously. Let them not worry about passwords any longer. Trust me, they will thank you.
