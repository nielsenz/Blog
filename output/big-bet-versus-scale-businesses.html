    <p>There are industries which are focused on creating a blockbuster. Movie studios, video game companies, and venture funds are all examples of industries that rely on outsized returns on a few properties to generate a majority of their profits. While looking for each &#8220;blockbuster&#8221; losses are generated on bets that don&#8217;t pan&nbsp;out. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there are the companies that focus on selling millions of units and getting a little bit of money from every sale. Examples for this type of business include clothing, retail, and running ads on a website. These are all ideas where money is made based on the idea of scale or reach. By getting a small amount from as many people as possible, the goal is to receive enough nickels and dimes from everyone to make a&nbsp;fortune.</p>
<p>Each side has its own pros and cons. For a blockbuster industry, it&#8217;s important to accept that you&#8217;ll most likely be losing money on a majority of deals. For venture funds, I&#8217;ve heard numbers ranging from <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/729876612846493696">half</a> to<a href="http://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html">80%</a>, which can be hard to swallow for many. However, when that blockbuster finally hits, the rewards are&nbsp;otherworldly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re a scale business you can rest easy knowing that you&#8217;re making money on every unit sold. However, you&#8217;ll never get that 10X return that can be common in a blockbuster industry. In addition, you&#8217;ll be at the risk of being commoditized. <a href="http://zachnielsen.org/abstraction-as-a-way-of-life.html" title="Abstraction article">Abstraction is the way of the world</a>, and it is especially true in retail. From Sears came Walmart, and now we have Amazon. Notice newspapers: the money is falling out of the industry because the internet does what they do&nbsp;better. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure which option I prefer. Each is optimized for it&#8217;s specific field; predicting what startup will generate those 10x returns is neigh impossible, thus it&#8217;s built on making lots of bets. Trying to find a series of small yet profitable investments doesn&#8217;t fit with how the business is run. Similarly, there are some clothing companies that focus on making outsized returns <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> but clothing and style often aren&#8217;t defensible. Is buying a four hundred dollar shirt worth it when I can buy a similar shirt for a tenth of the cost? The type of business follows the incentives of the&nbsp;industry. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to realize what type of company you&#8217;re currently in, and optimize accordingly. If you&#8217;re in a scale based business, focus on decreasing price to increase revenue. Meanwhile, if you&#8217;re in a blockbuster business, focus on finding the blockbuster. Don&#8217;t hang out in the middle, scoot to either side of the bell&nbsp;curve. </p>
