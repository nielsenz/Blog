Summary: The perfect compliment to a great NBA game

I find that the more I think and learn about NBA statistics, the more interesting the game becomes to me. This then implies that I am watching more and more NBA games. 

One tool that is perfect on the second screen is the live game stats from [Cleaning the Glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com). Itâ€™s a great way to check in and see how the game is shaping out in real time. Well worth the subscription if you are at all an NBA fan.
