I came across a weird bug that took me a few minutes to solve. I was using pandas get_dummies function (which was absolutely terrific) but wasn't able to access the columns after. 

After noodling for a minute, I used print(list(Data)) to see that the columns weren't strings, so I just referred to them with the numbers. Tough bug which was interesting to fix.
