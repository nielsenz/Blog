I really enjoyed [this piece by Robert Mays](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2019/11/21/20975461/josh-allen-buffalo-bills-quarterback-perception) about Josh Allen, the Bills QB. There were really two arts that stuck out to me: one was hearing about how he was talented in several sports in high school. He seems to think it’s a reason why he struggled in his first year, when the book Range suggests that it could be why he’s succeeding. 

The second is about how he really committed to getting better on intermediate throws, and how it’s really paid off. From the piece:

> “A year after consistently struggling to place intermediate throws, Allen has been one of the league’s most accurate passers in that area of the field. He’s completed 64.7 percent of his throws between 10 and 20 yards this season—a jump of nearly 16 percentage points from his first season. Allen’s biggest gains in 2019 have come where he faltered most as a rookie.”

Really crazy. I know everyone says that they’ve been putting in the work, but the results aren’t always apparent. Here, you can really see the results unfold. 

Overall, well worth the read.
