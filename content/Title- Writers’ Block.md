Summary: Here’s an easy tip on how to get past Writers’ Block

Coming up with blog posts has not been a difficult for me, as long as I am staying busy and creating. If it does become a problem, I can always come back to this [Seth Godin post](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/talkers-block.html) about Talkers Block. In it, he notes that while people are regularly worried about Writer’s Block, they never are concerned about Talker’s Block. People never wake up and say “I am not sure what to talk about today!” They simply talk. 

This same attitude can be applied towards writing. One method that I’ve heard which captures this idea is the idea of [Morning Pages.](http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/) The creator, Julia Cameron, says that 
> Morning Pages are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing, done first thing in the morning.

Even if the three pages are incoherent ramblings or to-do lists, just moving the (figurative) pen will help spark the brain.
