Title: Things to do in Boston

As a vaguely established Boston local, I often have people visiting who need to be entertained. To assist in this process, I’ve been putting together this list over the past year. Each of these options are worth trying, and I hope this helps anyone looking for things to do in Boston. 
## Food
- Buttermilk and bourbon
- Worden Hall - Southie

## By ICA/Harbor
- Harpoon Brewery and Beer Hall
- ICA
- Brattle book store
- Commonwealth books
- Blue Dragon (food)

## Cambridge
- Harvard Tour (Call Beforehand)
- MIT 
- Graffiti Alley
- Harvard/MIT musuems
- Myung Dong 1st Ave (Karaoke)
- The smoke shop
- Bagelsaurus (Life changing)

## North End
- I AM books 
- Improv 
- The Printing Office of Edes & Gill
- Mike’s/Modern’s Pastry 
- Paul Revere’s house/north church
- Captain Jackson's Historic Chocolate Shop
- Ernesto’s 
- Green dragon/Bell in Hand

Pro tip: Coming out of Mike’s pastry, turn left. A blockish down is a nice grassy area to consume the pastry. From there, you can catch the freedom trail to Paul Revere’s house/Faneuil hall

## Misc
- Bunker hill memorial
- Oyster House
- Zoo
- Bully Boy
- Plymouth (somewhat of a drive)
