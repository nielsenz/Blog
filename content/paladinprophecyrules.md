A recent game changer for my reading habit has been setting up Libby. Libby is a service that allows for ebook downloads from your local library. It's really allowed me to work through some fun Sci-fi and Fantasy books, without paying for instant download via Kindle (which is dangerous to get used to). 

One book that I really enjoyed was *The Paladin Prophecy*, by Mark Frost. It's solidly Young Adult, but a classic well-written adventure. Throughout the book, the protagonist cites rules created by his father to live by. I wanted to save those, so I have them written below.

## Dad's Rules
1. The importance of an orderly mind. 
2. Stay focused on the task at hand. 
3. Don’t draw attention to your self.
4. If you think you’re done, you’ve just begun. 
5. Trust no one.
6. Remain alert at all times to the reality of the present. Because all we have is right now.
7. Don’t confuse good luck with a good plan. 
8. Always be prepared to improvise. 
9. Watch, look, and listen, or you won’t know what you’re missing.

15. Be quick but don’t hurry. 
16. Always look people in the eye. Give them a handshake they’ll remember.
17. Start each day by saying it’s good to be alive. Even if you don’t feel it, saying it- out loud- makes it more likely that you will. 
18. If #17 doesn’t work, count your blessings. 
19. When everything goes wrong, treat disaster as a way to wake up.

23. When there’s trouble, think fast and act decisively. 
24. You can’t change anything if you can’t change your mind. 
25. What you’re told to believe isn’t important: it’s what you choose to believe. It’s not the ink and paper that matter, but the hand that holds the pen.  
26. Once is an anomaly. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is a pattern. And as we know…
27. There is no such thing as a coincidence. 
28. Let people underestimate you. That way they’ll never know for sure what you’re capable of. 
29. You could also think of coincidence as synchronicity. 
30. Sometimes the only way to deal with a bully is to hit first. Hard 
31. It’s not a bad thing, sometimes, if they think you’re crazy. 
32. Even the slightest advantage can mean the difference between life and death. Never give it away. 
34. Act as if you’re in charge, and people will believe you. 
35. Trying times are not the times to stop trying.

47. Out of control anger will get you killed even quicker than stupidity. 
48. Never start a fight unless you can finish it. Fast. 
49. When all else fails, just breathe. 
50. In times of chaos, stick to routine. Build order one step at a time. 
51. The only thing you can’t afford to lose is hope.

56. Giving up is easy. Finishing is hard. 
57. If you want to know what’s going on in a small town, hang around the barbershop. 
58. Facing the truth is a lot easier, in the long run, than lying to yourself.
59. Sometimes you find out more when you ask questions to which you already know the answer.
60. If you don’t like the answer you get, you shouldn’t have asked the question.

72. When in a new place, act like you’ve been there before.

78. There’s a reason the classics are classics: they’re classic.
79. Don’t make another’s pain the source of your own happiness. 
80. Go easy on the hard sell. Persuasion is the art of making others believe it was their idea.

20. (from Ajay) It is our rarest possession, more precious than any treasure from nature, God, or man. It cannot be bought, sold, traded, or stolen. You only have so much of it, and you never know when it will run out, so you mustn’t waste it or just let is pass or, heaven forbid, ever try to kill it.  
**It is time. Spend your time wisely. For if you can master this one simple and elusive skill, my friend, you will fully and truly be alive.**
