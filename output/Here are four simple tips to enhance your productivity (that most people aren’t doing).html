    <p>Excel, for those of you who are unaware, is a spreadsheet application. Imagine a series of rows and columns where one can put anything at all. Intuitively, it’s common in a business setting; being great at excel can set up a career for success early&nbsp;on. </p>
<p>Having transitioned to the working world, I now live in excel. Coming from a Computer Science background, I immediately want to focus on the quickest and most efficient way to do things. I wrote some tips below as a reminder to myself, and as a way to level up your excel&nbsp;usage. </p>
<p><em>Note</em>: The meta-lesson is to make sure all your keyboard commands are in order. On windows, the control key plus the arrow key moves to the end of the row (until there is no more text). Shift highlights text. Arrow keys move the field. Pretty simple, but ultimately a more efficient way to move around the&nbsp;worksheet. </p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine if you were entering text in a row. It’s built-in computing nature to press enter after typing; however, after pressing enter Excel defaults to the cell beneath the cell you were typing in. By highlighting the list of cells to alternate between, enter can then be pressed to switch between&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Columns, rows, and cells are referred to by their position. Columns are letters (A,B,C…) and rows are numbers. This feature can let us say “Oh, what is in cell A4?” However, that’s not readable, especially when writing formulas. There is a fix; cells can be aliased <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> i in the upper left section of the screen (by the area that says the current cell name). The main benefit of this is that a formula can be readable by humans - instead of multiplying A7 by V43, we can see&nbsp;that </li>
<li>Vlookups are a classic power user feature, <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> although they have one main problem - memory usage. If you have several vlookups in a spreadsheet, it can impact speed and performance. However, if you use the match and index functions, that combination is quicker and more memory&nbsp;efficient.</li>
<li>If you’re in an excel sheet doing a ton of various calculations, crazy decimals may be making an appearance. One function that helps with that is the round function. By using round, everything can be limited to 2 decimal places right off the bat, instead of running into strange extra decimal&nbsp;errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Excel is a robust program that is common in the business world. It’s worthwhile to learn the efficient ways of working, which will provide dividends in the long&nbsp;run. </p>

<p>If you spend a ton of time trying to fit two pieces of data together, definitely look them up. They’re super powerful. Highly recommended learning about them&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
