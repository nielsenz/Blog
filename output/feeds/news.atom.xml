This event was particularly meaningful to Apple, as it was  the first event to be held in the new Steve Jobs Theater. The news was expected; several leaks before the event made sure there would be no surprises. However, I watched the whole thing and came away with a positive&amp;nbsp;impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation started off with the very touching tribute to Steve Jobs. Tim Cook brought up a sound clip of Steve Jobs discussing how making great products is a way to give back to the world. I thought it was very tastefully done; as a fan of Steve Jobs, I knew that while not perfect, he advanced computing while keeping it humane and understandable for everyone to&amp;nbsp;understand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list was retail. Retail as long been a strength of Apple, and transforming stores to be more of a meeting and hang out space is the next step in luxury retail. Technology has a fundamental communication problem; there&amp;#8217;s often no instruction manual for the products you are given. These stores give Apple a way to teach the less technology savvy how to best use their products. I believe that doubling down on this is a strong move, and bodes well for retaining the less technology savvy members of the&amp;nbsp;population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Watch and Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me the Apple Watch Series 3 and new Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; are incremental improvements. I do not own an Apple watch and this was not due to a lack of cellular in the previous versions. For those that often run or use it to exercise, cellular is a compelling feature. For the rest of us, it is a nice to have. Something to watch here is the battery life; active use of the watch may hit the battery life harder than before due to this cellular&amp;nbsp;radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, 4k and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDR&lt;/span&gt; in the new Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; are nice features, but not a new compelling reason to buy. A problem for Apple here is that all other players are under $100. Trying to convince a buyer to switch from an Amazon Fire Stick to an Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; with a 70 dollar increase in price is a tough sell. Other than that, Apple automatically upgrading all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt; movies to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDR&lt;/span&gt; is a nice touch, along with Prime Video support, in addition to the live sports feature that was demoed. As a millennial cord-cutter, I would love to see Apple advance the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; space. The disparate apps for different content is painful, and I am hoping to be able to get all the content I want by the time I can fit a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; in my apartment.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;iPhone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least are the iPhones that were announced. The announcements were in line with the leaks, meaning that along with the next revision of the iPhone, called iPhone 8 instead of iPhone 7s, we have a high end iPhone called the iPhone X.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The iPhone 8 seems like a typical advancement of the iPhone line; the camera gets slightly better, the token new feature is announced &lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the chips in the phone get a new&amp;nbsp;advancement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireless charging does seem interesting; I am glad to see Apple supporting open standards. On one hand, having these charging pads built into tables is a terrific use case. It seems less appealing when I have to set a phone specifically on a wireless charging pad. The Apple branded wireless charging released next year looks like a great way to be able to charge all Apple products at&amp;nbsp;once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; and machine learning advancements clearly show where Apple believes the future is headed. Being able to build their own silicon puts Apple heads and shoulders above any other company. I think that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; is going to be the &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/apple-moves-into-ar.html"&gt;next stepping stone for Apple and it’s App developers&lt;/a&gt; and look forward to seeing where the space goes from&amp;nbsp;here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;iPhone&amp;nbsp;X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long rumored iPhone X also was released today and looks incredible. The bezels are removed, meaning that the screen fills edge to edge with the exception of a notch in the top. From an industrial design perspective, this phone will set the trend for the next 10 years of the iPhone. However, the increased size of the screen means that the famous home button and Touch &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; are disappearing. To combat this, Apple is introducing Face &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;, the ability to unlock your phone with your face. This feature will make or break the iPhone X; I will be interested to see what the reviews of the feature&amp;nbsp;are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concluding&amp;nbsp;Remarks.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I have a positive impression about Apple’s Keynote. By introducing a halo product &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for the iPhone, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt; should increase across the iPhone line. By removing the Touch &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; from the iPhone X, Apple also inadvertently gave users a reason to pick the old model; there will be no “why am I buying an old iPhone” trepidation, as opposed to when the 5c came&amp;nbsp;out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, solid improvements to the Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; and Apple Watch will be welcomed by users of their products. For myself, I do not feel the desire to upgrade from my iPhone 7. While the iPhone X is definitely the new hotness, I have found that the best thing to do is to give Apple time to improve a new design. I will be interested to see what features catch on and which do&amp;nbsp;not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As jokingly pointed out, something like this would look a lot like cable! &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having read &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/x_man"&gt;John Gruber’s piece&lt;/a&gt; about the name of this iPhone, I thought it would be called the iPhone X instead of the iPhone 10. However, Apple threw a wrench in their plans and stuck with calling it the iPhone 10. What happens in 2 years? I guess that is a problem for future Apple to solve.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, wireless charging. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning something for all iPhones to aspire to. An example is often a supercar made by a car company. Sales are not high, but it shows where the industry is headed. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

What doesn&amp;#8217;t give enough attention is that the Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; was announced at the same time as the iPhone, and yet the two products have completely divergent paths. The iPhone fundamentally changed society, upended entire industries, and created several new&amp;nbsp;ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; on the other hand did none of these things. For a long time it was a hobby product, and as only been revised three times since that initial offering. Like Thompson, I find great solstice in the fact that Jobs didn&amp;#8217;t know what the impact of the iPhone would bring. The future is a vast, unknowable thing and it’s glorious to see that no one can truly predict the future, not even Steve&amp;nbsp;Jobs. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apple"></category><category term="iphone"></category><category term="apple tv"></category><category term="future"></category><category term="steve jobs"></category></entry><entry><title>More on Apple’s Pricing Strategy</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/more-on-apples-pricing-strategy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2017-04-05:/more-on-apples-pricing-strategy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple’s choosing an interesting method to price&amp;nbsp;iPad’s.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Keeping largely in line with my article on &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/do-you-really-need-a-new-macbook-pro.html#do-you-really-need-a-new-macbook-pro"&gt;the new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, Above Avalon has &lt;a href="https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2017/3/29/apple-is-pushing-ipad-like-never-before" title="Above Avalon iPad Pricing Piece"&gt;a piece&lt;/a&gt; regarding Apple’s new pricing strategy. As I discussed, Apple is moving the MacBook Pro higher up the pricing “curve”, positioning the iPad Pro as an entry gadget into the Apple ecosystem. By making the MacBook Pros more expensive, a user has to choose between using an iPad or paying more for the privilege of using a&amp;nbsp;computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t talk about the low end of the iPad market in that piece, but Cybart nails it. We’ve reached peak iPad mini with the release of the 5.5 inch iPhones, and by positioning the 9.7” iPad at a cheaper price Apple is able to make an iPad a much more appealing product. The Average Selling Price (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt;) remains high because of the much more expensive iPad Pro and the accessories that come with it (such as the Smart Keyboard and pencil). I think that the iPad is in a good place, and Apple has positioned it effectively for the&amp;nbsp;future. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apple"></category><category term="pricing"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="iPad"></category><category term="above avalon"></category></entry><entry><title>Incentives Leading to Fake News</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/incentives-leading-to-fake-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-04-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2017-04-02:/incentives-leading-to-fake-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just another example of applied&amp;nbsp;economics.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was deciding to start my blog, I was thinking about what I would write about. Certainly I wanted to talk about technology, data science, as well as economics. However, I could have scrapped all of those options and wrote fake news&amp;nbsp;instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A true primer on fake&amp;nbsp;news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that are unaware, fake news is exactly what it sounds like; what many do not know is that some websites make their &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/23/503146770/npr-finds-the-head-of-a-covert-fake-news-operation-in-the-suburbs" title="NPR Fake News"&gt;entire living from&lt;/a&gt; the concept.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, one of the most fascinating pieces I read during this election season featured &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo?utm_term=.jq6GKG7ya#.vi4252rpN"&gt;teens in Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; who ran hundreds of pro-Trump fake news websites to earn a&amp;nbsp;living. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ender’s game speaking&amp;nbsp;truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first came across the idea of fake news when I was reading &lt;strong&gt;Ender’s Game.&lt;/strong&gt; In the novel, Ender’s brother (Peter) and sister (Valentine) start blogs in order to gain influence and prominence on earth. The quote below is &lt;a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/endersgame/section10.rhtml"&gt;from Sparknotes&lt;/a&gt;, showing their initial plan on how they will&amp;nbsp;succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valentine knows that Peter can find peoples fears and manipulate them and that she can persuade people to do what she wants them to do, and realizes that there is much of Peter in her—they both manipulate in their own ways. He has a plan to take over the world. As he explains to her, he will gain power, one way or another. It is in his nature to control. With her help he can rule over something worthwhile. They begin to use the nets to communicate political ideas, Valentine as the radical Demosthenes and Peter as the moderate Locke. Their ideas begin to spread, and Peter has lots of patience.
I find it fascinating that a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game"&gt;fiction book from 1985&lt;/a&gt; predicted the playbook of fake news in the internet era. Say what you will, Orson Scott Card predicted this era of fake news&amp;nbsp;perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bringing Fake News into the modern&amp;nbsp;era&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I bring this up is that I recently came across this &lt;a href="http://www.fakeittomakeitgame.com"&gt;fake news game&lt;/a&gt; and shows the perfect fake news playbook. I found the game utterly fascinating in an examination of incentives. It’s a lot easier to spread untrue articles that pray on fear as opposed to more positive articles.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This results in higher traction, resulting in higher ad revenues. Thus, ad revenue incentives the author to publish fake&amp;nbsp;news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Incentives rule the&amp;nbsp;world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an economist, I think a lot about how incentives guide human behavior. Fake news is one example of how incentives are distorting the overall news industry. The problem is only exacerbated when other mainstream media companies are subject to these same pressures to chase ad revenue, and thus give these fake stories&amp;nbsp;attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fake&amp;nbsp;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, &lt;a href="http://www.fakeittomakeitgame.com"&gt;Fake It to Make It&lt;/a&gt; is a fascinating example of how incentives distort the news industry. I think this game is both fun and shows the danger of fake news. It demonstrates how crucial being an educated news consumer is by  being aware of the incentives of the news&amp;nbsp;publisher. &lt;/p&gt;

In this vein, I came across &lt;a href="https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2017/3/15/the-curious-state-of-apple-product-pricing"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from the fantastic &lt;a href="https://www.aboveavalon.com"&gt;Above Avalon&lt;/a&gt; about how Apple is pricing two of their more recent goods. As Cybart&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Apple pushes deeper into luxury brand territory, the company is making its products more accessible through lower pricing. At $159, Apple is underpricing AirPods. The same can be said for Apple Watch, priced at $269. In just ten years, we have moved from the &amp;#8220;Apple Tax&amp;#8221; days, when Apple was accused of pricing products artificially high, to Apple products being priced below the competition. Apple is using its balance sheet and scale to grab new users, and in the process, redefine&amp;nbsp;luxury.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, excellent analysis and a great example of what pricing looks like in the real&amp;nbsp;world. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apple"></category><category term="pricing"></category><category term="above avalon"></category></entry><entry><title>Perfect Competition Assumptions in Real Life</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/competition-assumptions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-02-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2017-02-17:/competition-assumptions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Showing perfect competition assumptions hold up in real&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In another win for economic theory,&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I read a recent &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/17/14647870/us-carrier-unlimited-plans-competition-tmobile-verizon-att-sprint"&gt;Verge article&lt;/a&gt; regarding how competitive pricing by T-Mobile forced Verizon to bring back an unlimited data plan. Later, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;T and Sprint followed suit.  The article&amp;nbsp;reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what prompted this about-face that offers not just its first real unlimited plan in over half a decade, but one with prices and perks so generous that T-Mobile, Sprint, and (to a lesser extent) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;T spent the week scrambling to match&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple answer is competition. T-Mobile, for all its underdog nipping at Verizon’s heels, is slowly catching up to Verizon — while it still doesn’t have nearly the customer base, T-Mobile is at the very least putting up a fight with Verizon when it comes to coverage, speed, and&amp;nbsp;reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Verizon’s perceived network advantage is no longer strong enough to keep its best customers on unattractive rate plans and it was forced to respond,” reports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTIG&lt;/span&gt; analyst Walter Piecyk, which, along with T-Mobile announcing a record porting ratio against Verizon in Q1 2017, may explain Verizon’s sudden change in&amp;nbsp;attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This falls in line exactly with competitive supply and demand theory. &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As mobile phone service is becoming more and more homogeneous &lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, service lock-in is falling. Combine that with the ability to look at and compare differing plans via the internet, &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; these factors force prices to fall, benefiting&amp;nbsp;consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also recent reports of Sprint and T-Mobile &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/17/14651640/sprint-t-mobile-merger-2017-fcc-softbank-deutsche-teleko"&gt;restarting merger talks&lt;/a&gt;, which could reverse these trends that we&amp;#8217;re seeing currently. I believe that mobile phones have changed the environment for the better; making sure everyone can access them will be key in the upcoming&amp;nbsp;years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, consumers!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could make the comment that we&amp;#8217;re really seeing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_competition"&gt;Bertrand Competition&lt;/a&gt; and they would not be wrong; however, I&amp;#8217;m focusing on the competitive demand aspects to make a point about homogeneous services. Regardless, we end up with the same result. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
