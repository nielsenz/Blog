Aptly titled &lt;em&gt;Writing a Novel With Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, the book is an instruction manual about how to get the most out of the Mac and iOS app. First created in 2012, this app has grown to be tremendously popular as a minimalist writing application. Ulysses lacks features, like the ribbon in Microsoft word, but bills it’s simplicity as a feature instead of a bug. This allows the writer to focus on the most important job at hand, which is putting words on a&amp;nbsp;page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewson himself is a novelist, and I enjoyed his take on the application. As opposed to reviews from technology websites, he has used this app to write several novels which adds a believability to the book which I found appealing. Overall, I enjoyed reading how he set up the application to best maximize his writing&amp;nbsp;potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markdown&amp;nbsp;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulysses uses a variant of text styling which is called Markdown. Originally created by John Gruber of &lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;, Markdown makes text creation very simple. By removing the multiple menu bars and ribbons, it lets the author focus on writing. There are a few stylistic options: an H1 (first level header) is denoted by an ampersand, like&amp;nbsp;so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\#First Level&amp;nbsp;Header&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, bold can be denoted by two asterisks like the following:  **Bold&amp;nbsp;Text**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that are used to the ubiquity of word documents, there may be a fear that Markdown documents are some artisanal file that can only be read by Ulysses.  Because Markdown documents are simply plain text, they can be read and edited by any number of programs. I would say that they may even last longer than a word document of the same age.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Ulysses offers a wide variety of export options; these include text files, markdown, word, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;, and ePub. This is not a program that your work will stay trapped in, unable to leave. I found the export options to be sufficient for a wide variety of uses (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;’s and Word documents being my most common) and the templates they turned into looked&amp;nbsp;fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Book&amp;nbsp;Itself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book itself reads like an enhanced instruction manual; reading free blog posts and slight fiddling with the application will get you 90% of the material in the book. Like with any instruction book, there were some good ideas that I haven&amp;#8217;t even considered, some ideas that I already knew, and some ideas worth exploring. This is a perfect book to give you a start to finish guide about setting up Ulysses. However, if you are experienced with Ulysses, there may not be much new material for you in this&amp;nbsp;book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a structure in the book; from the initial fiddling around with settings to  exporting the finished product, Hewson touches on every step in the process. This presents a great walk through of what writing in Ulysses actually looks like, which I am all&amp;nbsp;for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an inherent beauty within Markdown. Its power is that it gets out of the way with the most important thing being the words on the page. Overall, I had takeaways which I immediately implemented &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it was interesting to see how a fiction writer has his work environment set up. If you are interested in a new, more minimal writing application or have purchased Ulysses but haven&amp;#8217;t done much with it, this book is for&amp;nbsp;you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word may not be able to read a file from 2001, but a markdown file will be good forever. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typewriting mode in particular was a godsend &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#8217;d like to review a book that I have read many times titled &lt;em&gt;Glory Road&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Glory Road &lt;/em&gt; is a science fiction book written by Robert Heinlein. It is the story of a man on a quest; he gets sucked into an adventure, and realizes that that&amp;#8217;s what his life has been missing this whole time. This struggle between a life of adventure and a life of peace gives the book its title: the protagonist is &amp;#8220;walking the glory road.&amp;#8221; To me, this book is one of my favorites because it captures the struggle to find meaning in life as well as the hunt for a purpose. This is a story of finding one&amp;#8217;s place in the world; something we can all relate&amp;nbsp;to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Narrative&amp;nbsp;Arc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book follows a typical arc for a Heinlein science fiction. We find that our protagonist, Oscar, had to enlist in the military because he lacked funds to complete college. From there, we find the book&amp;#8217;s raison d&amp;#8217;etre; he answers a classified ad in the newspaper and starts to explore different cultures with the heroine, Star, and his groom, Rufus. These different cultures and creatures demonstrate the authors command over Science fiction and magic; there are other cultures explored and fantastic creatures to fight. Finally, we have roughly half of the book devoted to what happens after the adventure is complete. To me, this is equally as interesting as what happens before, even though there is less &amp;#8220;action.&amp;#8221; Heinlein has a tendency to wax philosophically and this is in full display during the latter section of the book. I found myself delighfully engaged due to this book having helped to crystallize a fundamental question about life: what is it&amp;nbsp;for?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential turn&amp;nbsp;off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect that may prove distasteful for readers is that it was written in the 60&amp;#8217;s and is a product of its times. There are statements about the differing gender roles that may be distasteful to some; however, I submit that there is still value and truth to be found while reading this book. If this is the type of thing that can ruin a novel for you, I humbly recommend passing and finding a more modern book to&amp;nbsp;read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What it makes me think&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most intoxicated parts about reading is coming back to a book, and finding out if it still has a similar effect on you. I can say that I still rank this book highly in my mind; however, now there are different sections of the book which are more meaningful to me. Initially, I found a quote early on discussing what the hero wants from life to be very impactful; now I relate mostly to the post-adventure portion of the novel. When Oscar discusses the struggle between the sedentary life and a life of adventure, I find myself wondering if I am spending my life in the best&amp;nbsp;way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think that this book is fascinating, both as a case study and as a tool for reflection. As a case study, this book is a perfect example of hero/heroine science fiction written in the 60&amp;#8217;s. Also, this book raises several questions for living a better life such as if people can settle down and what happens when automation destroys a majority of jobs in the upcoming years?&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highly&amp;nbsp;Recommended&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t help thinking about how automation plays into this; a universal income seems lovely, but what happens when humans don&amp;#8217;t have a reason to wake up in the morning. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
