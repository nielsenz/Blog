Summary: A friendly reminder if animations are not your thing. 

Recently I came across an [interesting article](http://robservatory.com/speed-up-your-mac-via-hidden-prefs/) on how to speed up mac animations using the terminal. The terminal can be frightening for a lot of people, but these tips are pretty easy to implement and an explanation is given on what each command does and how to reset them.
