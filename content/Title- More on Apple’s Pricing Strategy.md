Summary: Apple’s choosing an interesting method to price iPad’s. 

Keeping largely in line with my article on [the new MacBook Pros](http://zachnielsen.org/do-you-really-need-a-new-macbook-pro.html#do-you-really-need-a-new-macbook-pro), Above Avalon has [a piece](https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2017/3/29/apple-is-pushing-ipad-like-never-before "Above Avalon iPad Pricing Piece") regarding Apple’s new pricing strategy. As I discussed, Apple is moving the MacBook Pro higher up the pricing “curve”, positioning the iPad Pro as an entry gadget into the Apple ecosystem. By making the MacBook Pros more expensive, a user has to choose between using an iPad or paying more for the privilege of using a computer. 

I didn’t talk about the low end of the iPad market in that piece, but Cybart nails it. We’ve reached peak iPad mini with the release of the 5.5 inch iPhones, and by positioning the 9.7” iPad at a cheaper price Apple is able to make an iPad a much more appealing product. The Average Selling Price (ASP) remains high because of the much more expensive iPad Pro and the accessories that come with it (such as the Smart Keyboard and pencil). I think that the iPad is in a good place, and Apple has positioned it effectively for the future.
