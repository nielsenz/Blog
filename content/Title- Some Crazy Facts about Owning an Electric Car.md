Summary: If everyone read this article, more people would definitely own electric cars.

As someone who participated in the electric car movement, it does my heart good to see that [oil companies are acknowledging the fact that all cars will be electric.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-25/electric-car-boom-seen-triggering-peak-oil-demand-in-2030s) The lack of maintenance is the true game changer (no more oil changes!!) along with never going into gas station makes owning an electric car worth it. 

To show how useful an electric car can be, I found [a real life case study](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/10/04/so-i-bought-an-electric-car/) regarding a used Nissan Leaf. The author does a great job of running all of the numbers, and shows how electric cars would take over the world if not for a lack of knowledge regarding their benefits. 

I think that electric cars are the way of the future [^1], and it’s crazy to see oil companies acknowledge that. Running the numbers, an electric car makes more sense both for practicality and just on a pure cost basis.
