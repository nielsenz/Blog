Summary: Unlocking Apple’s most powerful photo feature yet

One of the most requested features from Apple’s Live Photo is the ability to change what frame is displayed in the photo. Until I read [this post](https://thesweetsetup.com/change-key-photo-live-photos/) from the Sweet Setup, I did not realize that it was possible to accomplish this. 

All one has to do is to go into Photos, hit edit, and then by scrolling through the frames, a box that says “Make Key Photo” will be displayed. Super easy and useful, what a tip to dramatically increase the utility of Live Photos.
