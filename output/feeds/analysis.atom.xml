In it, he talks about how the papers at Sloan&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are getting less  replicable due to researchers not releasing their data sources. This lack of open source data is stifling the open source community; any new analysis is going to be hampered by the data that they have available to them. To reiterate: although analytics formed from public mailing lists, analytics innovation is now being driven by companies and analysts inside sports teams, because these companies are scared of giving up a strategic or monetary&amp;nbsp;advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completely checks out in the economic culture - open source has been studied in innovation economics and has several benefits that don&amp;#8217;t appear on a balance sheet. These benefits would be called positive externalities. For example, imagine if a team released a new type of data to the public. While at first glance this is not a smart business move, it could lead to a no-name analyst putting out ground breaking analysis on Reddit, who could then be hired for a job. I know that teams are always looking for great analysts to hire, and this could be a cheap way to do that. Or perhaps this data could be remixed by the open source community, and could jumpstart entirely new trends in the field of analytics. These benefits are not obvious at first glance; however, they are valuable and should be considered in the cost/benefit&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Glancing around, they seem to be mostly filled by students and the occasional businessperson. I think that there is an interesting question at hand: is there a shortage of coffee shops in the Boston&amp;nbsp;area?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Economist, I always have equilibria on my mind. If I believe that the coffee shop equilibrium is always having a place to sit and if the coffee shops are always full, this indicates that we have a shortage of coffee shops in the city of&amp;nbsp;Boston.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I began to think - while the coffee shops are filled with people, I’m not exactly sure how many of them are making any money. Indeed, many tables only have one or two drinks on them; not necessarily big spending items. While talking informally with the staff at a few of these shops, I realize that the students often purchase a tea and sit at the coffee shop for&amp;nbsp;hours.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I fit in with the majority; I have only purchased a tea so far. Perhaps this implies that we are at a coffee shop equilibrium; population does not necessarily imply&amp;nbsp;profitably. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Economics"></category><category term="equilibrium"></category><category term="coffee shops"></category></entry><entry><title>Warby Parker</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/warby-parker.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-07T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-11-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2017-11-07:/warby-parker.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Warby Parker is showing how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; can be a game&amp;nbsp;changer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16619124/warby-parker-iphone-x-app-face-mapping-glasses"&gt;The Verge reports&lt;/a&gt; that Warby Parker is using Apple’s ARKit to help them size glasses on customers. The process of buying glasses at Warby Parker can be a painful back and forth process and this could help customers more easily visualize how the glasses will look on their faces.

Throughout this blog I try and stay focused on the practical; one way to do so is by a case study. Below I will lay out an example company that has does not have a data driven decision culture and explain how they can begin using data to make&amp;nbsp;decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are a greeting card company, focusing on luxury greeting cards. The prices are higher than what people are used to paying for a card, but you think the benefits are worth the cost. You have multiple categories of cards, such as birthday and Halloween cards as well as the ability to offer coupons. Currently you have an online store but management is thinking about opening up a retail store and would love insight as to what would be the best location. If I was an analytics manager, where would be the areas that I could apply analytics and immediately see&amp;nbsp;results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stocking&amp;nbsp;Tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there are a number of ways. I would first start a customer profile page, where the customer enter in important dates. By being able to track certain dates customers buy cards for, a follow up email can be sent next year for a card of the same type. In other words, if they buy a birthday card on July 29th, it stands to reason a birthday is coming up and that they will want to buy a birthday card the next year as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would also help with making purchasing decisions in the aggregate. If a large majority of birthday sales happen in the summer months, it would make sense to order more birthday cards than usual. This would help keep shipping times low and customer satisfaction&amp;nbsp;high.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bundling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also start to look at bundling different card types together. In Economics, bundling can be used to maximize producer revenue. Here, I would look at pairing cards that are not top sellers with cards that are, or offering a slight discount to those that buy multiple cards in a&amp;nbsp;pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examining profit margins per&amp;nbsp;card&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would look at the various profits per card; it stands to reason that if I have a lot of different card types, some cards make more in profit than others. By performing this exercise, the company as a whole can see if expectations match up with&amp;nbsp;reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have these profitability numbers for each card, we can examine if all the cards are profitable to begin with. If a certain type of card is not making money, we can examine why that is and if it is acceptable. Maybe one card is sold at a loss, but drives sales of a more expensive card. Or that this card often appears on social media, meaning that this card is more valuable then first&amp;nbsp;anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Market Basket&amp;nbsp;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we could look at market basket analysis of these cards.  In other words, are some types of cards sold together a large part of the time? If so, maybe that can be a discount that we&amp;nbsp;offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would all be groundwork, in order to make sure that all members of the business are on the same page. We could also look at various shipping costs (does it make sense to ship international/various states?) as well as the value of advertising. Finally, we can A/B test various areas of the website as well as different deals to see if sales increase or&amp;nbsp;not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retail&amp;nbsp;expansion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as retail searching, I would first focus on more standard analysis, trying first to answer the following questions: Is there an area with a lower cost to rent? Do we want to have a store in a high traffic (read: more expensive) area in order to boost awareness? How close are similar stores and do similar stores even exist? One useful model would be to use zip code income as a proxy for wealth, and focus on areas that have a high wealth.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Elasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question that I have is if cost affects sales. If we lower the cost per card by a dollar, does the increase in sales make up for the lost revenue? In economics we would call this an elasticity question, but knowing this answer helps set the optimal price for this good.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could also look at other factors. Do most of our sales come from a specific part of the country? If so, does weather there affect our sales? Does it make sense to open a store or storage facility there to reduce shipping&amp;nbsp;time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we can see that even with a simple retail business, there are a large amount of questions that can be asked and answered by business analytics.I hope this helps show why having a strong grasp on analytics can be crucial for any&amp;nbsp;organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thinking here is that a luxury card is a &lt;em&gt;normal good&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that consumption of this good increases as income increases&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is that if your good isn&amp;#8217;t a necessity, decreasing the cost increases revenue because the increase in sales overall makes up for the loss of revenue per customer, up to a certain point. If the good is a necessity, such as gas or water, increasing the price increases the revenue because the loss of customers is offset by the additional revenue per customer. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I threw the code up &lt;a href="https://github.com/nielsenz/National-Parks-Expander"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt; and the data visualization can be found &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/zach.nielsen#!/vizhome/NationalParkServiceAttendanceAnalysis/NationalParkAttendenceAnalysis"&gt;on Tableau&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first experience with Python came when I took a data scraping class in college. From there, I ignored it for about a year until I picked up a book titled &lt;em&gt;Automate the Boring Stuff&lt;/em&gt;. The book is terrific and details practical applications of programming, which my computer science degree was lacking. From there, I played around a bit with a simple script that &lt;a href="https://github.com/nielsenz/pdf-Combiner"&gt;combines two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then found a problem that I could practice my excel manipulation skills by programming with Python. As someone who has always loved the outdoors, I found an excel spreadsheet that has the attendance for every national park since 1904. In order to best visualize the data, I needed to manipulate the excel document so that it was in the correct format for visualization. I accomplished this by &lt;em&gt;expanding&lt;/em&gt; the dataset. Initially, I looked at a spreadsheet that had the &lt;strong&gt;Years&lt;/strong&gt; on top and the &lt;strong&gt;Parks&lt;/strong&gt; running down the spreadsheet. However, I needed a spreadsheet with three columns: Park, Year, and&amp;nbsp;Attendance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I had a great time writing this program. It was fun experimenting with and getting used to openpyxl and pandas. The meat of the program is in lines 13-27, with two loops to loop through each year per park and then per&amp;nbsp;park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for parks in range(2,376):&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;parkCode = 'B' + str(parks)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;parkNameCode = 'A' + str(parks)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;currentPark = sheet[parkCode].value&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;currentParkName = sheet[parkNameCode].value&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#And then this should get all the years per park&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;for years in range(3,115):&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;year = sheet.cell(row=1, column=years).value&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;attendance = sheet.cell(row=parks, column=years).value&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if attendance == None:&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;attendance = 0&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;df2 = pd.DataFrame({"Park Name" : [currentParkName],"Park": [currentPark], "Date" : [year], "Attendance" : [attendance]}, index = [coolindex])&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;frames = [df, df2]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;df = pd.concat(frames)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;coolindex=coolindex+1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a good sign that I now would do things differently. After my first &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/znielsen/analysis-and-prediction-of-student-performance"&gt;data science&lt;/a&gt; kernel on Kaggle, I now have more experience with Pandas and would use it exclusively. Openpyxl gave me the ability to select a cell by the row and column number, which was very&amp;nbsp;useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visualizations with&amp;nbsp;Tableau&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the spreadsheet the way I like it, I can now visualize the data using Tableau. My goal is to have two graphs: one that displayed average attendance versus total attendance and a heat map of the United States showing the national park attendance. This was my first time making a heat map in Tableau and it could have not gone&amp;nbsp;easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attendance versus Average&amp;nbsp;Attendance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first looked at the data, I wondered how the average attendance per park differed from the overall attendance. Were there years that had a high average attendance but low overall attendance? Or as more parks were added to the national parks system, did average attendance decrease? By graphing this, there’s an intuitive way to see if the trends are the same or not. As we can see, there are slight variations but overall the trend lines are the&amp;nbsp;same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one design decision that was interesting to think about was if I should add dual Y axises, putting the two lines on the same graph. I decided against it, because I think that dual axises are misleading. If I tried to synchronize the axises, the average attendance is so much lower than the overall attendance it just looks like a horizontal line near zero. Although hilarious, it’s ultimately useless and that’s why I chose to stick with the two separate&amp;nbsp;graphs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; National Parks Heat&amp;nbsp;Map&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other visualization that I wanted to create was a heat map. For those unaware, a heat map is a type of graph that colors different fields darker depending on the value. Oftentimes a heat map is applied to a spreadsheet with darker values surrounding higher values. For example, if you had a spreadsheet with monthly sales, a darker green would mean a higher value than a lighter&amp;nbsp;green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other place where heat maps are used are to show data on a map. By placing all of the national parks on a map of the United States, the national parks that are darker have more visitors than those which are lighter. It would be fun to look at different parts of the United States and see if there’s any correlations, as well as just see if the visitors move westward as more parks are opened in the&amp;nbsp;west. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat park itself was pretty easy to create. The mapping data was also provided from the park service, and I used a simple join to the data I created with the python file to associate it together in Tableau. From there, I just had one remaining design choice: should the user be allowed to select one year at a time, or should the user be allowed to select multiple years at&amp;nbsp;once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that are unaware, Tableau has a bunch of ways to filter dates. The two that apply here are a singular selection &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or multiple date selection.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Both have pros and cons, the most notable being the multiple selection is messy but more efficient and visa versa. Ultimately, I decided to go with the multiple selection, but I may transfer back to the single use if users are having trouble with the multiple&amp;nbsp;selection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was excellent to get back into the swing of things. Instead of using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; to manipulate the data, I can see how Python fits into a data visualization environment. I could have even graphed the data using Python; however, I wanted to practice my mapping skills in Tableau. I can’t wait to see how this graph looks and what other insights may come from this&amp;nbsp;data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning that whatever dates the user wants to select can be selected. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/arkit/"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iOS 11 introduces ARKit, a new framework that allows you to easily create unparalleled augmented reality experiences for iPhone and iPad. By blending digital objects and information with the environment around you, ARKit takes apps beyond the screen, freeing them to interact with the real world in entirely new&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question becomes why Apple would want to get into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt;. Certainly Tim Cook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/10/14581428/apple-tim-cook-ar-vr-product-reveal-interview"&gt;made mention&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; being the next frontier, but it does seem like a strange strategy when &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; consists of holding up a screen to look through. For those who don’t know what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; is, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; is augmented reality. Pokemon Go is probably the most popular example, but there are plenty of examples of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; becoming more and more prevalent.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hardly a revolutionary thought, I think that Apple may be making &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; glasses. This then reveals Apple&amp;#8217;s strategy: they are trying to create content now to be able to benefit them them. One thing that this allows us to do is then skate to where the puck is going and figure out how we can benefit from the upcoming &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; trend. Early on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; will be complementary; it is only later that entire new uses for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; will emerge. While less interesting, we can examine different value propositions for current apps and see how they can use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; transformation to gain a competitive&amp;nbsp;advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I would love to hold up a mapping application like Yelp and be able to see the reviews of businesses around me in real life. This is definitely the future  and would make wandering around the city much more&amp;nbsp;interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; could also be added to any app with a personal profile. I can be at a networking conference and be chatting with a fellow attendee, and have their LinkedIn information pop up. Same for Facebook, or even a dating profile like Tinder or Ok Cupid at a singles only&amp;nbsp;event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt;, games are also much more immersive.  Tower Defense games become more engrossing if I can see the towers placed on my kitchen table. With a game like Minecraft, you will be able to build a monument while exploring your house. Similarly, any fighting games where you can see the characters appear and start to fight drags you into the&amp;nbsp;action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; becomes an incredible value proposition for many types of apps, even in these early days of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; Kit. This will only benefit Apple as more and more apps integrate with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; Kit, giving them a massive content advantage when they release their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;glasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show how useful an electric car can be, I found &lt;a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/10/04/so-i-bought-an-electric-car/"&gt;a real life case study&lt;/a&gt; regarding a used Nissan Leaf. The author does a great job of running all of the numbers, and shows how electric cars would take over the world if not for a lack of knowledge regarding their&amp;nbsp;benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that electric cars are the way of the future &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and it’s crazy to see oil companies acknowledge that. Running the numbers, an electric car makes more sense both for practicality and just on a pure cost&amp;nbsp;basis.&lt;/p&gt;

You may want to think about these flaws&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite tech products that doesn&amp;#8217;t get enough attention is the Kindle. The e-ink screen along with the small footprint makes it my favorite reading device. I have a Kindle Paperwhite and love it, but because I love it I know the device’s flaws better than&amp;nbsp;anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that bothers me is how painful the store is to navigate. Taps sometimes do not register, the store gets stuck while loading different screens, and in the Recommended for You section I find that the Amazon store recommends books that are not the first entry into a series  Why would I want to buy the fifth book in a series?&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally in the Recommended for You section, I keep browsing books that I have examined and ignored at an earlier time. I would love some way to be able to hide books that are recommended, so that I don’t see them again. Reading the summary of a book repeatedly will not change my opinion on purchasing that&amp;nbsp;book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second area that could be improved would be the grouping of books. Often I want to reread a series, yet if I search for the series title I can’t determine which book is first. Imagine a kindle that automatically grouped books in a series together. I should be able to search “Harry Potter” have have the kindle show me the entire list of Harry Potter books, in&amp;nbsp;order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of grouping, I would love tags while searching my library. Imagine if books were intelligently tagged based on data from the Amazon web store. Oftentimes I know I’d like to read a science fiction book, but I often have a desire to read a specific type of science fiction book. Imagine if I could search for a phrase like “I’d love a science fiction book with aliens and spaceships, with a focus on world building.” That would cut down on the time spent browsing my library, and allow me to spend more time reading.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would love better interaction with authors. Amazon owns the indie book market, but seems to pay no attention to it. I have to follow authors’ blogs on my own, resulting in a tangled web of extra chapters available, various book release dates stored in my head, as well as any spin offs or other blog posts that could have book related information. Amazon could completely control this market if they could allow authors to post updates to individual series. Imagine opening up one’s kindle and receiving a&amp;nbsp;notification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author X just put out a new sample chapter for the Great Book Series. Would you like to read it now? (In case you forgot, here’s a summary of the first three books that you read)  It’s expected to come out on May 5th! Get excited, and don’t forget to&amp;nbsp;preorder!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would promote user engagement, earning more money for both Amazon and the authors. These updates don’t have to be limited to sample chapters of upcoming novels either; they can be promotions for other work, notifications about book sales from your favorite authors,&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or just general&amp;nbsp;updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential for the Kindle remains high. It is already so good at being a book reader; however, Amazon could really take it into the stratosphere with a few simple changes. This product has a bright future, and I look forward to seeing what Amazon does with it&amp;nbsp;next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d default to always show the first book in a series, or something like that. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Amazon’s Recommended for You section has the basics in place. I can search for just science fiction books or non fiction books that Amazon suggests for me. I’d love it Amazon could take searching a step further, similar to how Netflix recommends movies. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a notification like “We saw you read X by this author; did you know his other series is on sale for 99 cents?” would be worth its weight in gold. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Below are a few bullet points for why the company could either succeed or&amp;nbsp;fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bull&amp;nbsp;Case:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have executed flawlessly so far. This post by Ben Thompson &lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; describing Snap&amp;#8217;s product strategy (termed &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/snapchats-ladder/"&gt;laddering up&lt;/a&gt;) is worth reading in it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;entirety. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find that they currently have a majority of mindshare with the teen demographic. Much of communication that I see among teens in the United States happens over&amp;nbsp;Snapchat. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The management team maintains all of the voting rights for Snapchat. If you think the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Spiegel"&gt;Evan Spiegal&lt;/a&gt; is a product visionary, his control over Snapchat will not change after the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&amp;#8217;re cool and continue to innovate.&lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bear&amp;nbsp;Case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The S-1 document shows that Snap has an increasing cost per customer, while revenue per consumer is mostly flat. This puts them in a bad position, making it difficult to turn a&amp;nbsp;profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is actively trying to crush Snap and has been for awhile. After a failed acquisition attempt, Facebook tried to &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/17/5817996/facebook-slingshot-app-vs-snapchat"&gt;clone Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/9/5700732/facebook-poke-is-dead-and-so-is-facebook-camera"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;. After those attempts failed, Instagram copied the story functionality from Snapchat wholesale, causing &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/slowchat/"&gt;Snapchat&amp;#8217;s growth to crater&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To add insult to injury, Facebook is now &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/25/facebook-stories/"&gt;testing similar functionality&lt;/a&gt; in the Facebook&amp;nbsp;App. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snap&amp;#8217;s entire strategy is based on out maneuvering the competition. If Spiegal somehow misses a trend and someone else can capitalize, thatcould spell doom for the&amp;nbsp;company. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no wrong choice here. On one hand, Spiegal is a one of a kind product visionary and it makes sense to believe that he and Snap will continue to succeed. However, Snap is facing a challenge with Facebook&amp;#8217;s blatant duplication of Snapchat&amp;#8217;s core features. No matter what happens, it will be interesting to see if Snap can succeed or if market forces sink the&amp;nbsp;company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that are unaware, the bull case would be the best case scenario, or reasons to believe that Snapchat will be okay. The bear case is the opposite, which would be the reasons for pessimism.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Indie author Drew Hayes has a new book coming out, and put out requests for those who wanted to cover the work in some way. He was kind enough to answer my questions about pricing and being an indie publisher, and I thought I&amp;#8217;d add a book review for some background. Please let me know what you think. As far as disclaimers go, I was provided a review copy of the book early and didn&amp;#8217;t receive any monetary compensation for such a&amp;nbsp;review. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always struggle finding new books to read. The rise of online publishing means that it&amp;#8217;s easier to create books, but unfortunately this implies a lower average quality per book.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This means that finding an author who puts out great material on a regular basis is like striking the&amp;nbsp;lottery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, Drew Hayes is one of those authors. I started off with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, then Pears and Perils, and then moved on to his magnum opus, Super Powereds. For those that are unaware, Super Powereds is originally a serial online about students going to a super hero college.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Once each school year is completed, Hayes publishes all of the chapters for that year in a book and sells it wherever one buys such things. The world the characters inhabit is complex, lacking the sharp moral divide that we expect from our marvel-based&amp;nbsp;media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forging Hephaestus&lt;/em&gt;, Hayes most recent work, is no different in this respect. Although the protagonist now plays for the Villain side, the world is similar to that of Super Powereds - complex, with interesting characters and fascinating super powers. It&amp;#8217;s safe to say that if you enjoy Super Powereds, you&amp;#8217;ll enjoy &lt;em&gt;Forging Hephaestus&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our protagonist in this book is Tori Rivas. At the beginning of the story, she is a small time thief who gets caught. Yet instead of imprisonment, she is taught how to use her powers in a more effective manner. Bigger truths about the world are revealed to her, there are fights with super powers and it&amp;#8217;s generally a good time. I found that I cared about her and her development. Watching the relationships between all the characters grow was satisfying in a way that made me feel that they would be fun to hang out with. This book doesn&amp;#8217;t break any new ground, with all the typical tropes present one could expect.&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Hayes does execute these in a skillful way, leading to an engaging&amp;nbsp;storyline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On other notable aspect of this book is its length. There is enough material in here for two books and I appreciate the story building that goes on. The book ebbs and flows in a way that brings me deeper into the storyline, rather than being distanced by the traditional story narrative.&lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I am glad that he didn&amp;#8217;t split this into two books; the true buildup comes at the very end. In the last 20 pages, Hayes ties all of the storylines together in a satisfying way, while keeping the book open for the next entry into the&amp;nbsp;series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that have read Hayes before knows exactly what they&amp;#8217;re getting into; snappy dialogue, believable characters, excellent world building, as well as great action. I&amp;#8217;m excited for the next book in the series; considering that this book hasn&amp;#8217;t officially been released, I think that&amp;#8217;s quite an accomplishment. For those that haven&amp;#8217;t read Hayes before, I think going onto his website and reading Super Powereds is a great start to see if you enjoy his writing. If you do (and I have a strong inkling that you will) I think this book would make a great next read. If you can&amp;#8217;t tell by now, I thought the book was great. His books can be found on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forging-Hephaestus-Villains-Code-Hayes/dp/1515912965" title="Amazon Link"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or his &lt;a href="http://www.drewhayesnovels.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think if J.K Rowling was the only person who could publish. Books would be pretty good, right? But then add in four random strangers. The overall quality would decrease. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gross simplification, but it is fantastic. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Who&amp;nbsp;knew!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When studying microeconomics, a typical question for a monoploy proceeds as follows: What is the best way to capture all the consumer surplus?&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Consumer Surplus" src="http://zachnielsen.org/images/ConsumerSurplus.png" title="Illustration of Consumer Surplus"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to capturing this surplus can be done in a couple of ways. Ideally, as a producer I could know what each person was willing to pay as soon as they walked in to my store. That way, all I had to do was to set the price of my good equal to that amount, and take all of the consumer surplus as&amp;nbsp;profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that isn&amp;#8217;t possible for a variety of reasons (yet).  By being forced to set the same price for each customer, there&amp;#8217;s an inefficiency that exists. Customer 1 may be willing to pay 100 dollars, but customer 2 may only be willing to pay 80. By setting my price as 80, I end up with more profits than if I set the price to be 100&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, yet I&amp;#8217;m still leaving money on the table for customer 1. The best we can do  maximize profits is to approximate, and different methods of price discrimination exist to help solve that&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One method of approximation is to set the cost of one unit equal to it&amp;#8217;s marginal cost, and then take out the consumer surplus through some other sort of fee. Continuing with the above example, I can set the price equal to its marginal cost (say 20) and then force consumers to pay off the total consumer surplus. This can be done either by bundling, where the bundle is priced at the amount of the consumer surplus, or more commonly is through some sort of up front fee. In the vein of Costco and Sam&amp;#8217;s Club, this technique is popular among wholesalers. In a real life example, we can take Costco. In a Costco, the goods are priced at marginal cost, but there is an entrance fee in the form of a membership to access these cheaper&amp;nbsp;goods.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example that struck me was an Open Bar. If we take the cost of the alcohol as fixed&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as well as noting that the supply of labor is fixed for that night&lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, then the marginal cost of an alcoholic beverage is zero. By selling the option of an Open Bar, the bar is attempting to capture all of the relevant consumer surplus ahead of time as opposed to taking it out piecemeal, drink by drink. The cost of the Open Bar most likely outweighs what one would have spent on alcohol to begin with; the bar ends up walking away with more money then it would have received otherwise.&lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s always fascinating to see pricing techniques being practiced outside of the classroom. The effectiveness of these techniques can be seen simply by how far they spread and how popular they&amp;nbsp;become. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer surplus is defined as the area above the cost curve and below the demand curve, or what consumers are willing to pay. See the graph below for an example. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For those that are unaware, Arment is an iOS developer and here he both provides his own iOS app sales data and well as linking to other posts with similar data. The data he provides is valuable, and it is worth going through old data to see what lessons we can draw from his real life&amp;nbsp;experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Data and&amp;nbsp;Conclusions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main conclusion that can be seen is that the first week after launch is when sales are at their peak. This makes sense logically, as marketing and press highest level.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, your biggest fans are waiting to purchase whatever you put out.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there begins the difficult task of convincing more indifferent people to try (and buy) your product.&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This can be seen in &lt;a href="http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/93118460565/a-candid-look-at-unreads-first-year" title="Unread's Sales Numbers"&gt;Jared Sinclair&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; about his app sales at the time&lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Unread. In his post, he makes the explicit statement that during the first week, &amp;#8220;Demand for your app will likely never be higher&amp;nbsp;again.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Qualifiers and Lessons&amp;nbsp;Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more recent data to look at as well, and the lessons it shows are the same. &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@genadyo/my-first-3-months-on-the-imessage-app-store-300044e6a15"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an example of an iMessage app, where most of the sales were immediately after the app was launched.&lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another interesting piece came from &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2016/08/vesper_adieu"&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt; on the end of Vesper, a notes app created by John Gruber, Brent Simmons and Dave Wiskus. It was a very interesting piece on what they would do differently. Gruber makes a great point on how luck plays a role in any venture; however, the market for a paid for iOS app is changing as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the main lesson to learn though comes from &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/pleco-building-business-just-app/"&gt;Stratechery,&lt;/a&gt; with regards to Sinclair&amp;#8217;s app. Thompson speaks to how the marginal cost for any app is zero; without meaningful differentiation, this implies that the cost of an app will fall to zero. Design for the sake of design won&amp;#8217;t earn you any sales, it is key to have a tangible reason on why someone will buy your&amp;nbsp;app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another lesson that was hit repeatedly was how crucial it is to have some sort of recurring revenue. Gruber mentions how they should have created a Mac app and charged for a sync service; many popular apps now follow a similar phenomenon&lt;sup id="fnref-6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Enterprise software has leaned towards a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAAS&lt;/span&gt; (software as a service) model for awhile. Some sort of recurring revenue will now be necessary to survive in the market. With prices falling, it becomes unsustainable to sell an app at a fixed&amp;nbsp;price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the main lesson is that without meaningful differentiation, price falls to marginal cost. Although the initial tendency to enter into a market may be driven by idealistic standards, it is still crucial to look at a market to determine the viability of entering. With meaningful differentiation though, the opportunities are&amp;nbsp;endless.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information always spreads slower than one thinks. Difficult to combat this trend. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thought experiment: a typical demand curve is defined by price; in a way though, isn&amp;#8217;t it also defined by desire (aka, elasticity) for a good?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Primarily, there are several terrible teams this season and a lack of an apparent super team. In addition, there may be too many games of football being played, resulting in football apathy&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Finally, the concussion problem being ever present may also be a concern to some&amp;nbsp;viewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard many solutions about how to fix this dilemma. Some of these solutions include removing the Thursday Night games completely, focus on streaming the games to millennials as well as implementing rule changes to make the game more palpable to watch. Though these solutions would no doubt benefit the game, I would like to add my own solution. My idea is simple yet effective: simply take away a quarter of play. This would make the format of the game similar to hockey, in that there would be three periods with two &amp;#8220;halftime&amp;#8221; breaks separating each period. This approach has several benefits that would make the game more interesting, increasing ratings across the&amp;nbsp;board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFL&lt;/span&gt; football game, endings are simply the most notable part of the game. Play during the middle five minutes are often forgettable. On the other hand, play during the last five minutes of each half are often remarkable. This is due to the increased pace of play as teams try and beat the clock. This hurry up offense is when football is at it&amp;#8217;s most entertaining. Teams are at their best, slinging the ball far downfield in order to try and gain an advantage before the break. As a viewer, these are the parts of the game I remember the most, and my plan puts the focus on the more interesting&amp;nbsp;parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about my plan is that there is no decline in ad revenue. I would suggest against adding more time to the three periods as the whole goal is to reduce football fatigue. Instead, the ad revenue could be made up during the extra break between periods. This would give more time for analysis and the commercials could fit in here, keeping ad revenue the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my plan, there are several benefits and zero costs present&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Football often goes on too long, and shortening the game would make it more palpable for viewers across the globe. The extra break would result in an increase of the hurry up offense, further increasing the highlight potential of the sport as well. Finally, the extra &amp;#8220;half time&amp;#8221; between periods would make up the ad revenue and increase the studio analysis, lowering the fixed costs of those studios. This holiday season, let&amp;#8217;s remember to give thanks and make football more interesting to&amp;nbsp;watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The often terrible Thursday Night Games have been deemed a likely culprit. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am easily not a scientist, it would not surprise me that having more time to rest between periods would lower the concussion rate of football players, besides the fact that they are playing less.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is a complicated one, because there are benefits due to a relative as well as absolute increase. Receiving a raise is a common example of a relative increase, because one&amp;#8217;s wages are higher than they were before. Another example is when Walmart raised it&amp;#8217;s minimum wage but other companies did not. The wage Walmart paid was relatively higher, because other companies&amp;#8217; wages stayed the&amp;nbsp;same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, an absolute increase is when more money is getting paid out, but the other relationships between wages and products stay the same. The typical macroeconomics example includes wages being doubled but also having prices double. In this new world, if I want to buy something it still costs the same percentage of my wages. However, I do have more money overall than I did&amp;nbsp;before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get back to the question at hand, because a minimum wage increase means that wages are not higher relatively speaking, I see the point being made. The prestige of a higher salary decreases if I can transfer to another company paying the same salary. Put another way, if a company is paying a higher wage than all the other companies, I&amp;#8217;m more likely to stay there. However, if every other company is paying the same wage, there is no loss in salary to keep me committed to the&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, higher wages on an absolute basis do result in higher productivity, especially at a minimum wage level. A &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/nyregion/older-workers-are-increasingly-entering-fast-food-industry.html" title="Older Workers entering fast food industry"&gt;New York Times Article&lt;/a&gt; from a few years ago indicates that older workers are increasingly entering the fast food industry; these are the workers that would most benefit from a minimum wage increase. More costs are incurred as people age, and a higher wage can reduce some of the financial stress present.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Having more of a financial cushion lets workers focus solely on working, increasing their&amp;nbsp;productivity.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this clarifies the benefits that can result from raising wages. Raising the minimum wage level may not increase the relative benefits, but should result in absolute benefits. Whether or not that outweighs the cost of the wages is a discussion for another&amp;nbsp;post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, efficiency wage theory says that wages may not be at a level where the market clears. In other words, there is an equilibrium wage, and then a firm (or several firms) are paying a higher wage than before. This results in productivity benefits. In the original model, these benefits are due to a lack of shirking but more money can increase worker productivity in a number of ways (making sure transportation isn&amp;#8217;t an issue, being able to pay for medicine, better food, etc).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible examples of a higher wage increasing productivity include letting a worker purchase a more reliable car which makes transportation to and from work easier, letting the worker pay for child care, and being able to afford better medicine, resulting in less sick time being taken. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price Discriminate? Let me&amp;nbsp;explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price&amp;nbsp;Discrimination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than the much worse type of discrimination, &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination"&gt;Price Discrimination&lt;/a&gt; is the idea of selling the same product in different markets at different prices to maximize revenue. Two common examples include giving a student discount and feature reduction in software. A student discount is used to get students to pay for a product they otherwise would not buy. They often don&amp;#8217;t have the money to buy the good at full price&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so by using a student discount, a firm can still charge the same price to the old customers, yet also bring in a new source of&amp;nbsp;revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, another common example is hobbled software that can be sold for a lower price. Pricing software &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/how-to-price-a-digital-good.html"&gt;is complicated&lt;/a&gt;, but the key thing to remember is that the marginal cost is zero &amp;#8212; it doesn&amp;#8217;t cost more to produce an extra copy. However, by artificially removing features and selling it for a lower price, a software maker can appeal to different customer segments to maximize revenue. As an example, the popular statistics program Stata has &lt;a href="https://www.stata.com/products/which-stata-is-right-for-me/"&gt;five different versions&lt;/a&gt; of its product, all aimed at a different market segment. By having a cheaper version for students, Stata can capture the revenue it otherwise would lose if it just had one price&amp;nbsp;point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retina and&amp;nbsp;Price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple here is using this technique to differentiate between customer segments. Those who care about &amp;#8220;pro features&amp;#8221; are willing to pay for them &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the retina screen is an example of such a feature. In his article, Snell says&amp;nbsp;that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder: To what degree are Retina Macs more expensive because the Retina display (and the increased graphics power required to drive them) adds to the cost of making the device, and to what degree is it a feature differentiator that Apple feels it can use as a way to get people to spend more&amp;nbsp;money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a classic example of price discrimination. By keeping the price of computers with a retina screen artificially high, Apple is able to segment the market into those that will pay more for retina, and those that care less about the feature. For those don&amp;#8217;t care about a retina screen, they can buy a Macbook Air and still be happy with such a purchase. Apple still gets their money, and these users that are indifferent regarding a screen aren&amp;#8217;t paying for a feature they don&amp;#8217;t care about. Thus, Apple is able to capture revenue from both customer segments, making management, as well as the consumers&amp;nbsp;happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a discount often has tremendous appeal&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or begrudgingly willing to pay   &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The price is higher than before, and the touch bar seems underwhelming. The usual complaints of maximizing thinness at the expense of battery life and processing power &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/59onxt/preorder_shipping_megathread_mac_lineup_2016/#bottom-comments" title="Reddit preorder shipping thread"&gt;have been seen &lt;/a&gt;as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the computers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pierce/status/791707800879583232"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/"&gt;beautiful&lt;/a&gt;. And demand initially &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pierce/status/791695773486297088"&gt;seems high!&lt;/a&gt; The internals have finally been upgraded, and I am personally excited that they come in the official Space Gray, releasing us from our silver&amp;nbsp;shackles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s going on? Has Apple ceded the pro market to Microsoft? If this computer doesn&amp;#8217;t appeal to professional consumers, who is it actually for? My theory is that Apple realizes that iOS is the future and is charging a legacy tax for everyone who wants to stick with a Mac. This legacy tax will turn consumers sunk costs into increased margins for Apple, while also promoting adoption of their future computing&amp;nbsp;platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of Computing is&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/791724227736985602"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/791724676158398464"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; tweets by Benedict Evans are right on the money. Apple realizes that iOS is the future of computing. Computing only ever gets more abstract &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and iOS is too good at abstracting the many difficult parts of computers away. Steve Jobs &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130109/steve-jobs-was-right-tablets-are-cars-pcs-are-trucks/"&gt;said it best&lt;/a&gt; when he compared PCs to trucks and tablets to cars. PCs will still be around for specialized tasks, but tablets (and even phones) will be good enough for most&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preferences are actually Sunk&amp;nbsp;Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the truth is that tablets are already there. iPads are good enough for 90% of my daily work. Yet people still prefer to have a computer to do &amp;#8220;real work&amp;#8221; on. People get stuck on what&amp;#8217;s been working for them, without exploring what&amp;#8217;s new or what&amp;#8217;s changed. I&amp;#8217;ve used Macs to email and surf the web for the past X years, so I&amp;#8217;m looking for a Mac to email and surf the web, without ever looking at the capabilities of anything else. These biases are present and they are all sunk costs. Apple is exploiting these costs by forcing those who prefer actual computer to now pay for that&amp;nbsp;privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making the pro market pro&amp;nbsp;again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumption rests on the fact that these consumers want the newest hardware. If not, there are plenty of &lt;a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/10/many-macbooks/"&gt;other Macs&lt;/a&gt; that Apple offers. However, those who want the newest hardware yet are unsatisfied with these new offerings are in a tough position. Either they need to fork over the cash to upgrade or switch over to the iPad Pro as a daily computing device. Now Apple can speed adoption of it&amp;#8217;s future platform as some users inevitably realize that an iPad Pro is good enough and switch while also increasing revenue&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for those that depend on a Mac&amp;nbsp;laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract, and also easier to use. For an example, take programming languages. Assembly got abstracted into C, which got abstracted into a bunch of different languages (Python, Ruby, etc). &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s actually an interesting question of elasticity. For those people who care about the cost of the Mac more than the experience of using a Mac (aka using a laptop is elastic), they&amp;#8217;ll either bite the bullet or switch to something else, most likely an iPad Pro. For those who have inelastic computing preferences (which I may have made up) aka those that will buy the computer regardless of any price increase, revenue will increase. Win-win. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

These areas are fragile and the importance of preserving these areas cannot be&amp;nbsp;overstated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an economist, I&amp;#8217;m most interested in Leave No Trace as a question of incentives. Why should I follow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNT&lt;/span&gt; principles in the wilderness when it&amp;#8217;s more work for me? To add salt to the wound, there is a high chance that I will not even get to see the fruits of my labor. If we follow the idea that consumers are rational, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNT&lt;/span&gt; does not seem to make sense&amp;nbsp;initially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the reason why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNT&lt;/span&gt; is so well followed is that it&amp;#8217;s part of a self perpetuating cycle; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNT&lt;/span&gt; is followed because those who go out into the wilderness care about the wilderness. Those are the people most willing to persevere the nature for the future generations and the best way to do this is to follow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNT&lt;/span&gt; principles. It&amp;#8217;s like teaching salesmen a new sales technique. They&amp;#8217;re going to follow the new strategies because it&amp;#8217;s in their best interest to do so. It&amp;#8217;s definitely an interesting thought though, one I plan to follow up&amp;nbsp;on. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="economics"></category><category term="thought experiment"></category><category term="lnt"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Raising the Minimum wage could be a good idea</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/raising-the-minimum-wage-could-be-a-good-idea.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-15T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-10-15:/raising-the-minimum-wage-could-be-a-good-idea.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;2 reasons. No conclusion. All serious&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Raising the minimum wage has recently been a hot button issue for many people. On one hand, we have those against such an increase. Their thinking goes that if the cost of labor increases, firms will shift away from that input (labor) and move towards other inputs (capital, etc). More people will then be unemployed, resulting in a loss of jobs for those who most need it. This theory can be found in any labor economics class and has guided decision making for&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the debate, we have those that are for such an increase. Oftentimes the only justification given is a moral one: it is impossible to support a family with a low minimum wage. However, there are ideas supporting such an increase: the income effect along with efficiency wage theory are two of them. A discussion on which side is correct is beyond the scope of this blog post; however, I will attempt to better illustrate what these benefits are and how they benefit both the worker and the&amp;nbsp;firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Income&amp;nbsp;Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The income effect says that increasing the minimum wage will give the workers more income (shockingly). The workers will then spend that money, increasing the demand for the goods that the workers buy. As a simple example, imagine workers at a widget factory. The wage increases for those workers. The workers then turn around and buy more widgets, because they can now afford to. This new demand for widgets forces the factory to increase output: potentially forcing the factory to hire even more workers! With the increase in output, the factory receives more profit and the workers have a higher wage. Everyone is happier with more money in their pockets, all due to the initial increase in the minimum&amp;nbsp;wage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Efficiency Wage&amp;nbsp;Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second benefit that can result from an increase in the minimum wage is efficiency wage theory. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_wage" title="Efficiency wage theory wiki"&gt;Efficiency wage theory&lt;/a&gt; is the idea that workers become more productive the more they get paid. While seeming counterintuitive at first, the idea makes sense logically; if I&amp;#8217;m getting paid a lot of money, I want to keep that job. This implies that I&amp;#8217;ll work harder at that same job, becoming more productive (and consequently more valuable) as a worker. The value that the company receives from me working harder may outweigh my additional pay. A recent &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/upshot/how-did-walmart-get-cleaner-stores-and-higher-sales-it-paid-its-people-more.html" title="Walmart Efficiency Theory"&gt;New York Times article&lt;/a&gt; shows a example of this idea being put into practice. Walmart increased the pay of their workers which resulted in more valuable employees. The stores were cleaner and customer satisfaction increased; well worth the slight increase in pay for those&amp;nbsp;employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article was not meant to offer a firm conclusion on raising the minimum wage; it was intended to spark a discussion on some of the undiscussed benefits that could result from such an increase. Raising the minimum wage is often defined as a no win situation; however, that is not the case. The income effect and efficiency wage theory demonstrates some of the value companies can possibly receive out of a increase in the cost of&amp;nbsp;labor. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="labor economics"></category><category term="labor"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="thought experiment"></category></entry><entry><title>Why aren’t office hours more flexible?</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/why-arent-hours-more-flexible.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-10-05:/why-arent-hours-more-flexible.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Who wouldn&amp;#8217;t prefer more flexible&amp;nbsp;hours?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One night, several thought occurred to me regarding hiring practices.
1. There is a certain nonzero percentage of people who are not morning people
2. These people are not enjoying the typical 9-5 job. 
3. It stands to reason that if companies want to be competitive in hiring the best talent, companies need ways to distinguish themselves. Shouldn&amp;#8217;t it be the case that there should be more choices offered regarding job hours, as a way to separate themselves from the&amp;nbsp;pack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why hasn&amp;#8217;t this&amp;nbsp;occurred?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be self perpetuating.  Because no high value employees have asked for it, no one asks for it. The other option is that the benefits of having everyone there at roughly the same time outweigh the costs of acquiring talent at a lower&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because let&amp;#8217;s be honest, who wouldn&amp;#8217;t give preference to a position with more flexible&amp;nbsp;hours? &lt;/p&gt;

Of note, he states that the demand of the exploits are the same, so it implies that higher cost of the iOS exploits is due to the limited supply of the iOS&amp;nbsp;exploits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#8217;ll add that there may be a demand effect here as well. &lt;a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/new-report-reveals-that-ios-users-spend-2-5-more-on-in-app-purchases-than-android-users-700983/" title="In App Purchase Link"&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; shows that iOS users spend about 2.5 times more on in app purchases. I think we can extrapolate this out to say that iOS users spend more on apps and in app purchases because they are generally the more affluent customers. Anecdotally, I also see many working professionals with an iOS device, thus presumably increasing the demand of such an&amp;nbsp;exploit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, while I agree with Person about the differences in supply affecting the price, I also think that there is a demand effect present as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apple"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="analysis"></category><category term="current"></category></entry><entry><title>An Analysis of the Phillips Curve</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/phillips-curve-analysis.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-25T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-09-25:/phillips-curve-analysis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Phillips Curve: Fact or&amp;nbsp;Fiction?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the macroeconomic theories that continues to persist is the idea of the Phillips Curve. &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve" title="Phillips Curve Wiki"&gt;The Phillips Curve&lt;/a&gt; is the idea that unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated. This means that the higher the unemployment rate, the lower the inflation rate. This idea comes from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A. W. H.&lt;/span&gt; Phillips’s study of wage inflation and unemployment in the United Kingdom from 1861 to 1957. The effect was then observed in the 1960&amp;#8217;s in the United States, where it then influenced policies and continues to hold on to this&amp;nbsp;day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, once the United States moved into the 1970&amp;#8217;s and beyond, the Phillips Curve turned out to be untrue. Indeed, there seems to be no correlation between unemployment and inflation. In order to demonstrate this, below is a graph that shows the annual inflation rate and unemployment values from January 1986 to August&amp;nbsp;2016.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Phillips Curve Graph" src="http://zachnielsen.org/images/Phillips Curve Graph.PNG" title="Phillips Curve, 1986-2016"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the graph, one can see that the scatter plot is extremely&amp;#8230;. scattered. If unemployment and inflation were inversely correlated, the points would line up similar to a capital letter L: a high unemployment rate would result in a low inflation rate and a high inflation rate would result in a low unemployment rate. Thus, the idea of the Phillips Curve does not hold&amp;nbsp;up. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="phillips curve"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="analysis"></category><category term="macroeconomics"></category></entry></feed>
