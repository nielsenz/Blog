Summary: Constant vigilance featuring tech and an animal metaphor

It is very important to always practice safe computer practices, and knowing about security is a key component of that. Much like knowing that a bee sting is painful, it is key to understand different hacking scams that exist in the wild.
  
In this vein, I recently read [an article](https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/16/certified-malice) about how HTTPS certificates can be easily faked. HTTPS certificates are often taken to be a perfect indicator for a secure internet connection, yet on the internet nothing is truly safe. It is best to be vigilant and only connect to wifi that you trust.
