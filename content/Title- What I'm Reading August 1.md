Summary: Podcasting may be more intelligent than before. 

I write this from Scotland, where I'm at for the month of July. The weather has been surprisingly balmy [^1] and I am enjoying all of the new food available to me. [^2] Now for some articles that I have been reading. 

I found [this article](http://www.marriagekidsandmoney.com/life-after-dave-ramseys-baby-step-7/) via Twitter, which talks about the best ways to save your money, once you've paid off all of the debt. I am still trying to understand the difference between retirement options, and articles like this help to clarify what the best move is. 

[This article](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/iqaluit-amazon-prime-1.4193665) talking about the benefits of Amazon Prime to a remote community in Canada. What's truly incredible is that Amazon is able to deliver food and other products to a very remote settlement, cheaper than the government. It shows how committed Amazon is to acquiring customers, and how dependanet people are becoming on the internet. It also reminds me of an article I read awhile ago talking about the effects Walmart has when it leaves a community.

[John Gruber wrote](https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/you_should_not_force_quit_apps) a fantastic article talking about why no one should force quit apps on their iPhone. Force quitting an app happens when you double tap the home button and swipe up the apps to make them disappear. Anecdotally, I am seeing this more and more and itâ€™s one of those things that is irritating. I think this may be my Alamo and will start relaying how useless this is. 

I thought this post [on work](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/24/new-status-symbol-hard-work-spending-ceos) was a terrific read. Working long hours has become a bragging competition, much to the detriment of workers. I recently found out that the E.U. bans working over 45 hours a week which helps remind the workers that they work to live, not live to work. 

Finally, I found [this article](http://www.financialsamurai.com/worst-landlord-horror-story/) talking about the cons of owning a rental property. I find that in the Financial Independence blogosphere, owning property becomes the de facto way to accumulate wealth; keeping negative case studies in mind can temper that urge to go all in.
