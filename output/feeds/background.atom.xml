In theme parks such as Disneyland, certain rides (splash mountain, etc) have a camera that automatically takes a picture of you during the ride. Disney also has several paid photographers walking around the park to take photos at certain&amp;nbsp;points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Disney, these photos probably aren&amp;#8217;t a huge money maker. I can&amp;#8217;t imagine that the cost of the photos pays for much more than the wages of the photographers, or even drives park revenue in a noticeable&amp;nbsp;way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the photos actually worth to the&amp;nbsp;company?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photos are interesting because of due to the multiple reasons for selling them. Currently, Disney is raking in huge margins. A relic of the pre iPhone age, a printed 5 by 7 inch photo can be around twenty dollars, which is an incredibly high price. To me, photos are an elastic good in that I&amp;#8217;m not willing to pay that high of a price for a photo, even if the photo does capture an excellent memory.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Similarly, instead of having a professional Disney photographers take my photo, I&amp;#8217;ve achieved similar results by asking a stranger to take my photo. To me, the difference is neglible. &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is some inherent value to the photo as well. If there is a photo prominently displayed in the household, it&amp;#8217;s 1. great marketing but 2. helps to remind the family of the great memories they&amp;nbsp;had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the photo is not without value.  Photos displayed are often great marketing tools, both by creating a halo effect by reminding the family of the great time they had, but also sparking conversations if people come to visit. Companies spend their whole marketing budgets on gaining mindshare; photos are an incredibly easy way to do&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thesis is this: Photos are an elastic good, and the high price are sunk costs from a previous generation. Photos should instead be seen as a marketing tool instead of a revenue generator. By lowering the price to something nominal (five dollars, say) more photos will be bought. The photos will then explode into homes everywhere, raising brand&amp;nbsp;awareness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For smaller companies, the question becomes more complicated. The photos sold could very well make up a significant portion of revenue. In this case, the decision would have to be made on a case by case basis. Photos could very well be an elastic good, and lowering the price could result in an overall increase in revenue. On the other hand, photos could also be inelastic for a smaller company&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, where decreasing price would decrease revenue as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there is nothing worse coming off a ride, seeing an excellent photo and then feeling your stomach drop after seeing the high price of that photo. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I&amp;#8217;ve often come off of rides that takes the photo while riding, and have seen people taking photos of the screen the photo is displayed upon. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a use of props, say. The company has a built in advantage to their photos that consumers are unable to replicate.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Movie studios, video game companies, and venture funds are all examples of industries that rely on outsized returns on a few properties to generate a majority of their profits. While looking for each &amp;#8220;blockbuster&amp;#8221; losses are generated on bets that don&amp;#8217;t pan&amp;nbsp;out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are the companies that focus on selling millions of units and getting a little bit of money from every sale. Examples for this type of business include clothing, retail, and running ads on a website. These are all ideas where money is made based on the idea of scale or reach. By getting a small amount from as many people as possible, the goal is to receive enough nickels and dimes from everyone to make a&amp;nbsp;fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each side has its own pros and cons. For a blockbuster industry, it&amp;#8217;s important to accept that you&amp;#8217;ll most likely be losing money on a majority of deals. For venture funds, I&amp;#8217;ve heard numbers ranging from &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/729876612846493696"&gt;half&lt;/a&gt; to&lt;a href="http://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html"&gt;80%&lt;/a&gt;, which can be hard to swallow for many. However, when that blockbuster finally hits, the rewards are&amp;nbsp;otherworldly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you&amp;#8217;re a scale business you can rest easy knowing that you&amp;#8217;re making money on every unit sold. However, you&amp;#8217;ll never get that 10X return that can be common in a blockbuster industry. In addition, you&amp;#8217;ll be at the risk of being commoditized. &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/abstraction-as-a-way-of-life.html" title="Abstraction article"&gt;Abstraction is the way of the world&lt;/a&gt;, and it is especially true in retail. From Sears came Walmart, and now we have Amazon. Notice newspapers: the money is falling out of the industry because the internet does what they do&amp;nbsp;better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure which option I prefer. Each is optimized for it&amp;#8217;s specific field; predicting what startup will generate those 10x returns is neigh impossible, thus it&amp;#8217;s built on making lots of bets. Trying to find a series of small yet profitable investments doesn&amp;#8217;t fit with how the business is run. Similarly, there are some clothing companies that focus on making outsized returns &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but clothing and style often aren&amp;#8217;t defensible. Is buying a four hundred dollar shirt worth it when I can buy a similar shirt for a tenth of the cost? The type of business follows the incentives of the&amp;nbsp;industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also important to realize what type of company you&amp;#8217;re currently in, and optimize accordingly. If you&amp;#8217;re in a scale based business, focus on decreasing price to increase revenue. Meanwhile, if you&amp;#8217;re in a blockbuster business, focus on finding the blockbuster. Don&amp;#8217;t hang out in the middle, scoot to either side of the bell&amp;nbsp;curve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to make the argument that abstraction and simplification are pervasive aspects of our society. In other words, things get easier over time. While there are some examples of how this doesn&amp;#8217;t hold up (makeup looks as incomprehensible to me as it would in the Victorian era) there are many more examples of this theory holding&amp;nbsp;true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From fistacuffs to Death Tubes to&amp;nbsp;gustar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my first example, I&amp;#8217;d like to bring up fighting and general warefare. Fighting went from something that took years to master &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to using a bow and arrow &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to rifles and now drone strikes. Someone in a chair halfway across the world can cause the same amount of damage as a medieval horde. In a similar case, modern basic training for infantry in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Army is 10 weeks, and yet these soldiers today are more efficient and well equipped than those in the&amp;nbsp;past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar case can be made with languages. As background, Spanish has three possible endings for verbs: -ar, -er, and -ir. The way the verbs get conjugated depend on the ending of the verb &amp;#8212; we play has an ending of -amos, but we live ends in -imos. This is because the infinitive verbs respectively end in -ar and -ir. &lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now contrast this with latin. Latin has &lt;a href="http://bencrowder.net/design/latin/conjugation-charts/" title="Conjugation chart"&gt;five possible endings&lt;/a&gt; and is significantly tougher to memorize than Spanish. French and Italian, more modern languages descended from Latin also have three endings. Additionally, the pervasiveness of English culture has led to a explosion of English &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword"&gt;loan words&lt;/a&gt; simplifying language even further. Twitter and tweeting are universal. &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sorry, this is not the computing language you&amp;#8217;re looking for: Please look for more&amp;nbsp;abstraction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers too have been following this same path. Initially, computers started out as logic gates: from there, they advanced to adding machines with &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era"&gt;punch cards&lt;/a&gt; for data input. After that, programming languages developed: Assembly, C, and then many others &lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Interacting with these computing devices also became easier. From the command line came the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref-6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which opened up computing to the masses. A visual metaphor made computing easier and more accessible to everyone. I could now double click on a folder and see the file pop up, instead of having to explain the terminal command &lt;sup id="fnref-7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A cell phone in every&amp;nbsp;pocket&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the computer abstraction story isn&amp;#8217;t done yet. Smartphones and tablets do away with much of the other friction that comes with using a computer. Who needs a file system when the data you need is right there, whenever you need it? No need to update the virus protection, navigate a folder hierarchy, or update drivers: phones and tablets are simply easier to use &lt;sup id="fnref-8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Smartphones are the first and only computers for a majority of the world&amp;#8217;s population, due (in part) to the fact that friction is abstracted away. &lt;sup id="fnref-9"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;point?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway is understanding that technological abstraction removes friction. Future innovations show this as well: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VR&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; will make interacting with menus a thing of the past. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; assistants and self driving cars are both examples of a difficult thing becoming easier. In order to predict the future, look at the points of friction and imagine those disappearing. That will probably be the direction that the future&amp;nbsp;heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sword fighting and hand to hand combat being obvious examples here.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which can be taught in months, if not quicker&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinitive verbs can be thought of a verbs in a base state: to play, to run. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I was taught that the Spanish verb for to tweet is tweetar. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C is the programming language that other programming languages are written in. Also, C is the forefather in a lot of ways. C++  was built to improve upon C&amp;#8217;s faults. Python abstracts all of the messiness away; &amp;#8220;dangerous&amp;#8221; behavior (such as pointers) just goes away. Whole errors of bugs just disappear.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aka the desktop&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not coincidentally, there was then &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3357701/Bill-Gatess-dream-A-computer-in-every-home.html"&gt;a computer in every home&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromebook&amp;#8217;s recent increase in popularity speaks to this as well. Schools don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about maintenance. The extra benefits in cost and ease of use add more reasons why this is a viable purchase.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-8" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-9"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d argue that a persistent 4G connection helps too. A dell with an ethernet connection is unsustainable in Algeria. More useful work can be done with an Android phone and a data connection. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-9" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sticking with the ebook example from the initial post, let&amp;#8217;s say that the first book in a series (book 1) is elastic &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, I believe that books get more inelastic the further along in the series you go. If I loved books 1-4, I&amp;#8217;d probably pay a high amount for book 5. This implies that the pricing for a book series could increase based on how far along a reader is in that series. As an example, if I had a book series, I could charge three dollars for the first book, four dollars for the second, all the way up to twelve dollars for the fifth book in the series. &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pricing can also be used and thought of as a marketing tool. Say you have a series of books as above. The first book as already recouped it&amp;#8217;s costs&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the current price is still set at three dollars. However, because the marginal costs are zero, you can now drop the price of the book for a short time (or forever) to capture new readers into the&amp;nbsp;series. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price can also decrease to capture &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer_surplus.asp"&gt;consumer surplus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, using a tool called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination"&gt;price discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, the digital good can be priced relatively high. This means that the sales are mostly made up of hardcore fans who would pay anything for the book. This also has the added benefit of keeping initial reviews of the book high, as your biggest fans can be counted on to have a mostly positive impression about your work. As sales max out at the high price point, the price can then be decreased, in order to move down the demand curve. In short, the people who are slightly more apathetic or are willing to pay less for your novel get the chance to buy the book. As the price decreases, more people will end up purchasing it, maximizing&amp;nbsp;sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also critical is knowing your place in the genre. If all the books in the romance section are seven dollars, and I&amp;#8217;m trying to sell a similar romance novel at fifteen dollars, I am not setting myself for success. Likewise, if you&amp;#8217;re trying to think of something to write, it&amp;#8217;s worth examining the other competitors in the market, to figure out if one genre is more profitable than another&amp;nbsp;genre. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, it&amp;#8217;s important to differentiate your good from others. A question worth asking is what makes your product defensible and different from everyone else&amp;#8217;s. &lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rules work for more traditional products as well. If I&amp;#8217;m selling a set of software productivity tools, I can have an introduction tool priced lower to sucker people into the ecosystem and then have complementary tools priced higher. Same if I&amp;#8217;m selling action figures. When selling anything it is important to scout the competition especially to find a way to differentiate your product. Pricing is a difficult and complicated topic that bears thinking about, and hopefully this article describes some of the most important factors at&amp;nbsp;play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(economics)" title="Elasticity Wikipedia"&gt;Elasticity&lt;/a&gt; is a well known, fundamental economic concept regarding price and the quantity of goods sold. A good is elastic if a change in price matters in determining the number of goods that are sold, relatively. For example, I raise the price of my widget by 5% and the quantity sold drops 20%. Elastic goods are often luxury goods. A good is inelastic if price doesn&amp;#8217;t matter as much. Think gasoline or electricity. Prices could go up by 5%, but you&amp;#8217;d still probably use the same amount of electricity. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, sales for each book in a book series most likely resemble a funnel. I would suspect that the first book in the series sells the most units, while each subsequent book sells fewer and fewer units. However, the fans that keep buying books are the diehard fans, making the sales of the book more inelastic. Thus, you are able to make up the revenue per book by increasing the price of each book in the series.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you&amp;#8217;re thinking of your digital good as a &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/how-to-price-a-digital-good.html"&gt;utility company&lt;/a&gt;, right?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which can be defined as the maximum amount of money the consumers are willing to pay for a good.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The goal of any price is to maximize revenue, and that happens when marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Thus, the price should be where this&amp;nbsp;occurs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For physical goods, this is relatively easy. Marginal cost is simply the cost of producing another unit and firms (should) have enough data on what that number is. Marginal revenue is slightly more complicated; it is the revenue gained from selling one more unit. With physical goods, firms should also have enough data to estimate the demand curve and thus guess at marginal revenue. However, for digital goods the question becomes less&amp;nbsp;simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Primer on&amp;nbsp;Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs for a good can be divided into two parts, variable and fixed. A variable cost is one that increases when the firm produces more goods, such as hiring salespeople or adding more inventory space. Fixed costs are costs that stay the same regardless of how many units you produce, such as buying the factory to produce the goods. No matter how many goods you produce, the cost of the factory will stay the same. The key takeaway here is that fixed costs don&amp;#8217;t increase marginal costs; the factory I had to buy to produce my widgets shouldn&amp;#8217;t enter my calculation when I&amp;#8217;m figuring out how many widgets to produce now. Thus, in order to calculate the marginal costs, simply figure out the variable costs associated with the&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a piece of software then (such as an app or an ebook) the marginal cost is zero. There are no variable costs! In order to &amp;#8220;print&amp;#8221; another ebook, it costs nothing. There are some fixed costs, such as hosting, but as stated above that doesn&amp;#8217;t enter into the marginal cost calculation. So now the question becomes what to charge for software? The firm could pretend that there are some some variable costs, increasing the marginal cost to something from zero. But that doesn&amp;#8217;t make any sense. I think the best way to treat a piece of software is to treat it like a utility&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Utilities as a form of&amp;nbsp;software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unpack the utility company metaphor, imagine an electric company. This electric company has high upfront costs and minimal marginal costs. In the beginning, the company has to string the power lines, install the generators, and generally build out the infrastructure. Setting up this infrastructure puts a company deep into the red. That is why there&amp;#8217;s usually only one power company in an area, because it just doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense to have two companies outlay these massive amount of funds &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But after the infrastructure is put up, the company has the ability to charge whatever it wants, for a good that has basically no marginal cost. It&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;dream! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A piece of software often follows the same path. Initially, the costs run deep as the development process occurs. However, once the software is built, the costs shrink and the revenue can start flooding&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A NaNoWriMo&amp;nbsp;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, we can use writing a ebook. November is &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org/"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; which is the national novel writing month. The challenge is then to write an entire book in one month, which works out to writing 2500 words a day. As a bold assumption, say that I am able to crank out those 2500 words in 3 hours. So during the month of November, I have one book sized collection of words for 90 hours of work. However, someone needs to edit the book. Having no idea how long it takes to edit, say that it takes half the time it would take to write the book (so 45 hours). Ignoring all other time costs (marketing, preparing the book for submission to the online stores) the minimum amount is 135 hours worth of work. At a working wage of $20 an hour, before taxes there is an initial outlay of $2700 to become an indie&amp;nbsp;author. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! Once I finish writing the book, my marginal cost is zero. I now can pick a price and sell my book at that price point in order to recoup my initial investment. Because I sank in all the time initially, I can ideally rake the profit that this book brings in forever. If the book sells even remotely well, I&amp;#8217;d consider that a fair&amp;nbsp;trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I&amp;#8217;d consider this a small (super small. Very, very tiny, minusculely small) sample on how to price something. There are other factors to take a look at (elasticity, price point in the market, as a sales technique) but from a purely economic standpoint, this is the technique used to figure out how to price&amp;nbsp;something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of being pure monopolies, such firms are often regulated by the government to prevent people from being priced out of the market (often called a regulated monopoly). However, if a firm is willing to pay to set up the infrastructure and enter the market, does that mean that the price is too high and competition would be good for the consumers? In addition, another question is that if the internet should be such a utility? I&amp;#8217;d argue yes, but these questions are a post for another day.  &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
