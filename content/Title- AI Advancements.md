Summary: Keeping an eye on AI is definitely a New Years resolution. 

While perusing [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/10/14220578/ai-deepstack-beats-poker-pros-no-limit-texas-hold-em), I came across an article about how researchers have created an AI that plays poker. This is a pretty incredible advancement, as poker is a much more complex game for computers to learn. 

Poker is a game where all of the information is not known. Players hands are hidden from each other, which makes the algorithm more complex. This type of game differs to a game like chess, where the state of the board is known to both players of the game. Because there is no hidden information, the optimal move can be found much quicker.  

This is further evidence that the AI revolution is coming, and will take over in realms that were often thought to be exclusive to human. Reading [The Second Machine Age](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Machine-Age-Prosperity-Technologies/dp/0393350649 "Amazon link") made the case that AI will get better at a faster rate. The state of AI is worth keeping an eye on.
