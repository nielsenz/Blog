In the spirit of  Sloan Sports Analytics Conference starting to sell tickets soon, I thought it would be fun to write down a few main points that I would think about while pricing sports&amp;nbsp;tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first concern would be to separate the experience artificially. Yes, the &amp;#8220;product&amp;#8221; is the same; the consumer sees the team play a game of basketball. But there is an “artificial” difference that I would be able to sell: how good of a seat they have. Thus, my first goal would be to examine the price point of these different&amp;nbsp;seats. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming that this plan passes muster, I would then look at ticketing plans. After separating the seats into different categories  &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; , I would then offer various programs for purchase: such as season, half season, what have you.  These unique plans would be beneficial for numerous reasons: much like airlines, you could give a discount on reserving all the games early. On the other hand, I could charge a premium for a one ticket game. This price discrimination has the effect of increasing revenue. In addition, preselling tickets gives the organization capital earlier, which is valuable in and of&amp;nbsp;itself. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would then measure customer churn, especially in the most valuable real estate. If all of the customers are not renewing their tickets in a particular row, is there something wrong with that row? Could the experience be improved in some minor way that would result in a significant revenue savings (aka not having to sell that seat&amp;nbsp;again)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would then change the single ticket price based on the particular game that is being played. If a trendy team or player is coming into town, I will charge more for that game as opposed to a less popular&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I get all of those ducks in a row, I could then look at the elasticity of the tickets. By varying the price slightly, I would see how changing the price affects the number of tickets sold. Perhaps some tickets should have their price raised, but others should have their prices lowered.  Deeper insight and slight variation of the ticket price should let the team hone in on what exactly the price should&amp;nbsp;be. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I would examine the average value of the tickets and see if any should be put on sale even further. By discounting those tickets (perhaps to students, veterans, and the elderly), I can further extract even more revenue. It’s better to sell the tickets at a discount as opposed to having an empty&amp;nbsp;stadium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this has been a great way to walk through the problems I would tackle in ticket pricing. If I were a business person at a sports team, I would have other issues to worry about as well (staffing and food sales to name two), but this would be the track that I would follow to gain insight into the ticketing&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having transitioned to …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Excel, for those of you who are unaware, is a spreadsheet application. Imagine a series of rows and columns where one can put anything at all. Intuitively, it’s common in a business setting; being great at excel can set up a career for success early&amp;nbsp;on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having transitioned to the working world, I now live in excel. Coming from a Computer Science background, I immediately want to focus on the quickest and most efficient way to do things. I wrote some tips below as a reminder to myself, and as a way to level up your excel&amp;nbsp;usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: The meta-lesson is to make sure all your keyboard commands are in order. On windows, the control key plus the arrow key moves to the end of the row (until there is no more text). Shift highlights text. Arrow keys move the field. Pretty simple, but ultimately a more efficient way to move around the&amp;nbsp;worksheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine if you were entering text in a row. It’s built-in computing nature to press enter after typing; however, after pressing enter Excel defaults to the cell beneath the cell you were typing in. By highlighting the list of cells to alternate between, enter can then be pressed to switch between&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Columns, rows, and cells are referred to by their position. Columns are letters (A,B,C…) and rows are numbers. This feature can let us say “Oh, what is in cell A4?” However, that’s not readable, especially when writing formulas. There is a fix; cells can be aliased &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; i in the upper left section of the screen (by the area that says the current cell name). The main benefit of this is that a formula can be readable by humans - instead of multiplying A7 by V43, we can see&amp;nbsp;that &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vlookups are a classic power user feature, &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; although they have one main problem - memory usage. If you have several vlookups in a spreadsheet, it can impact speed and performance. However, if you use the match and index functions, that combination is quicker and more memory&amp;nbsp;efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re in an excel sheet doing a ton of various calculations, crazy decimals may be making an appearance. One function that helps with that is the round function. By using round, everything can be limited to 2 decimal places right off the bat, instead of running into strange extra decimal&amp;nbsp;errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Excel is a robust program that is common in the business world. It’s worthwhile to learn the efficient ways of working, which will provide dividends in the long&amp;nbsp;run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.e. given a human readable name&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend a ton of time trying to fit two pieces of data together, definitely look them up. They’re super powerful. Highly recommended learning about them&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People predict by making up&amp;nbsp;stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People predict very little and explain&amp;nbsp;everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People live under uncertainty whether they like it or&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People believe they can tell the future if they work hard&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People accept any explanation as long as it fits the&amp;nbsp;facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handwriting was on the wall. It was just the ink that was&amp;nbsp;invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often work hard to obtain information they already have and avoid new&amp;nbsp;knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man is a deterministic device thrown into a probabilistic Universe. In this match, surprises are&amp;nbsp;expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that has already happened must have been&amp;nbsp;inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A part of good science is to see what everyone else can see but think what no one else has ever&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between being very smart and very foolish is often very&amp;nbsp;small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many problems occur when people fail to be obedient when they are supposed to be obedient, and fail to be creative when they are supposed to be&amp;nbsp;creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes easier to make the world a better place than to prove you have made the world a better&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;

If it does become a problem, I can always come back to this &lt;a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/talkers-block.html"&gt;Seth Godin post&lt;/a&gt; about Talkers Block. In it, he notes that while people are regularly worried about Writer’s Block, they never are concerned about Talker’s Block. People never wake up and say “I am not sure what to talk about today!” They simply&amp;nbsp;talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same attitude can be applied towards writing. One method that I’ve heard which captures this idea is the idea of &lt;a href="http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/"&gt;Morning Pages.&lt;/a&gt; The creator, Julia Cameron, says&amp;nbsp;that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning Pages are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing, done first thing in the&amp;nbsp;morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the three pages are incoherent ramblings or to-do lists, just moving the (figurative) pen will help spark the brain. &lt;a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2017/03/sometimes-the-only-way-out-is-through/?utm_content=buffer0e116&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=buffer"&gt;Ryan Holiday&lt;/a&gt; correctly notes that sometimes the only way out is through. &lt;em&gt;Just keep going&lt;/em&gt;, and there will be a light at the end of the&amp;nbsp;tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Writers Block"></category><category term="Seth Godin"></category><category term="Talkers block"></category></entry><entry><title>Surface 4 Pro Review</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/surface-4-pro-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-26T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-03-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2018-03-26:/surface-4-pro-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My Surface Pro 4&amp;nbsp;Review&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Surface Pro has, once the darling of the tech industry, has recently fallen out of favor in the media. I recently had an opportunity to review a Surface Pro, and below I wrote some quick thoughts about my time with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The keyboard was delightful to use. I particularly liked the&amp;nbsp;trackpad. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to download full Windows programs was&amp;nbsp;handy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trackpad, although nice to use, was necessary because Windows is particularly difficult to use with a touch-based&amp;nbsp;interface. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bezels on the machine were particularly thick coming from the world of&amp;nbsp;Apple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The screen resolution was particularly odd. This could have been the machine settings, but I felt as though the information density was very low on the&amp;nbsp;machine.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concluding&amp;nbsp;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a machine that was heralded to be the future of the industry, it seems to have fallen out of the public consciousness. I look forward to the Surface Pro 5 and whether a hardware reversion can address some of the negatives about the&amp;nbsp;machine. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Surface Pro 4"></category><category term="Microsoft"></category><category term="Windows"></category></entry><entry><title>Data Replicability</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/data-replicability.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-03-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2018-03-13:/data-replicability.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;By not releasing data, the analytics culture is only hurting&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought that Ben Falk had a great post on his excellent website &lt;a href="https://cleaningtheglass.com/sloans-evolution/"&gt;Cleaning the Glass&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he talks about how the papers at Sloan&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are getting less  replicable due to researchers not releasing their data sources. This lack of open source data is stifling the open source community; any new analysis is going to be hampered by the data that they have available to them. To reiterate: although analytics formed from public mailing lists, analytics innovation is now being driven by companies and analysts inside sports teams, because these companies are scared of giving up a strategic or monetary&amp;nbsp;advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completely checks out in the economic culture - open source has been studied in innovation economics and has several benefits that don&amp;#8217;t appear on a balance sheet. These benefits would be called positive externalities. For example, imagine if a team released a new type of data to the public. While at first glance this is not a smart business move, it could lead to a no-name analyst putting out ground breaking analysis on Reddit, who could then be hired for a job. I know that teams are always looking for great analysts to hire, and this could be a cheap way to do that. Or perhaps this data could be remixed by the open source community, and could jumpstart entirely new trends in the field of analytics. These benefits are not obvious at first glance; however, they are valuable and should be considered in the cost/benefit&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Glancing around, they seem to be mostly filled by students and the occasional businessperson. I think that there is an interesting question at hand: is there a shortage of coffee shops in the Boston&amp;nbsp;area?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Economist, I always have equilibria on my mind. If I believe that the coffee shop equilibrium is always having a place to sit and if the coffee shops are always full, this indicates that we have a shortage of coffee shops in the city of&amp;nbsp;Boston.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I began to think - while the coffee shops are filled with people, I’m not exactly sure how many of them are making any money. Indeed, many tables only have one or two drinks on them; not necessarily big spending items. While talking informally with the staff at a few of these shops, I realize that the students often purchase a tea and sit at the coffee shop for&amp;nbsp;hours.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I fit in with the majority; I have only purchased a tea so far. Perhaps this implies that we are at a coffee shop equilibrium; population does not necessarily imply&amp;nbsp;profitably. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Economics"></category><category term="equilibrium"></category><category term="coffee shops"></category></entry><entry><title>Alto’s Odyssey</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/altos-odyssey.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2018-02-21:/altos-odyssey.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep it short.

While I am interested in the technical aspect, I am unsure what the bot should actually&amp;nbsp;tweet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I thought about simply tweeting a work of classical literature. It would be reasonably interesting and not very difficult to create. I would simply have a file that contains the text that should be tweeted and loop over that, tweeting at whenever time period I set in the&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also thought of some sort of Markov chain bot; if I can feed the bot some interesting base text, it may generate some gems (see &lt;a href="https://filiph.github.io/markov/" title="Trump Markov bot examples"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for some examples using Trump). However, I’m not sure what base text I could feed to the bot to make it&amp;nbsp;interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I thought of having the bot &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DM&lt;/span&gt; me whenever some condition is met. If this bot check various &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;’s, I could have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DM&lt;/span&gt; notifications turned on. And then this app could &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DM&lt;/span&gt; me whenever some flag is met. Per usual, I am interested in the technical side of things, I’m just not sure what triggers I should set for this&amp;nbsp;bot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think bots have potential that has not yet been realized. I look forward to further experimentation with them and seeing what I can come up&amp;nbsp;with. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tech tips"></category><category term="bot"></category><category term="nltk"></category><category term="Markov chain"></category><category term="markov"></category></entry><entry><title>The four commands that really demonstrate how to use git and GitHub</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/the-four-commands-that-really-demonstrate-how-to-use-git-and-github.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2018-02-10:/the-four-commands-that-really-demonstrate-how-to-use-git-and-github.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After hours of searching for a great git tutorial, this help page demonstrates all one needs to&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ll have a better post up at some point on how I use git, but &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/"&gt;this help page&lt;/a&gt; from Github’s docs really does a great job describing the various&amp;nbsp;commands. &lt;/p&gt;

Presented by Al Sweigart, this video is a no nonsense look on how to get started with some basic&amp;nbsp;automation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Selenium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium is used in testing web apps; however, it can also be used to automate any online activity. His selenium example looks like the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;from selenium import webdriver&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;browser = webdriver.Firefox()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;brower.get('theurl.com’)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;element = browser.find_element_by_css_selector(the css selector)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;element.text&lt;/code&gt; 
&lt;code&gt;element.click()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;browser.quit()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example opens a web browser and navigates to a web page. From there, it finds a specific element, grabs the text and then clicks on that element. Selenium is useful because it can handle the minutiae that comes with navigating the&amp;nbsp;web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from the top, a simple &lt;code&gt;import selenium&lt;/code&gt; does not work, the key is to import the web driver from selenium. Lines 2 and 3 start a browser on screen and navigates to the inputted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line 4 is where the magic happens. Instead of trying to follow the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; chain, I can inspect an element on screen &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and then copy the selector path directly from the developer&amp;nbsp;tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other useful methods can be used to send keys, submit, and refresh a web&amp;nbsp;page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyAutoGUI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyAutoGUI is a package that is more useful with automating tasks on screen.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This module can be installed by using pip which looks like the following:  &lt;code&gt;pip install pyautogui&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be useful, PyAutoGUI needs the pixel coordinates of where to click. To solve this problem, there is a useful function called &lt;code&gt;displayMousePosition()&lt;/code&gt;. By running this function, the program will give a real time position for where the mouse is on the screen. This is a great way to plan out where the mouse needs to be in order to click the desired&amp;nbsp;targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there’s several other useful functions: &lt;code&gt;click(), typewrite(), hotkey('ctrl','o')&lt;/code&gt; are three of the most useful. Typewrite() is used to send text to the active program.  &lt;code&gt;moveTo()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;moveRel()&lt;/code&gt; will move the cursor to a specific point or in relation to where it is currently. Finally, there’s a &lt;code&gt;locateOnScreen()&lt;/code&gt; method to match a screenshot with something on&amp;nbsp;screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html"&gt;documentation &lt;/a&gt; online is well written and contains all of the methods that can be implemented with&amp;nbsp;PyAutoGUI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation is clearly the area where I am slacking the most. These tools have great potential to simplify the daily computing process and I look forward to trying&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which can be gathered by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; part of the name.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

First, you need some water. Fuse two hydrogen with one oxygen and repeat until you have enough. While the water is heating, raise some cattle. Pay a man with grim eyes to do the slaughtering, preferably while you are away. Roast the bones, then add to the water. Go away again. Come back once in awhile to skim. When the bones begin to float, lash together into booms and tow up the coast. Reduce. Keep reducing. When you think you have reduced enough, reduce some more. Raise some barley. When the broth coats the back of a spoon and light cannot escape it, you are nearly there. Pause to mop your brow as you harvest the barley. Search in vain for a cloud in the sky. Soak the barley overnight (you will need more water here), then add to the broth. When, out of the blue, you remember the first person you truly loved, the soup is ready.&amp;nbsp;Serve.&lt;/p&gt;

Ulysses lacks features, like the ribbon in Microsoft word, but bills it’s simplicity as a feature instead of a bug. This allows the writer to focus on the most important job at hand, which is putting words on a&amp;nbsp;page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewson himself is a novelist, and I enjoyed his take on the application. As opposed to reviews from technology websites, he has used this app to write several novels which adds a believability to the book which I found appealing. Overall, I enjoyed reading how he set up the application to best maximize his writing&amp;nbsp;potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markdown&amp;nbsp;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulysses uses a variant of text styling which is called Markdown. Originally created by John Gruber of &lt;em&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/em&gt;, Markdown makes text creation very simple. By removing the multiple menu bars and ribbons, it lets the author focus on writing. There are a few stylistic options: an H1 (first level header) is denoted by an ampersand, like&amp;nbsp;so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\#First Level&amp;nbsp;Header&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, bold can be denoted by two asterisks like the following:  **Bold&amp;nbsp;Text**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that are used to the ubiquity of word documents, there may be a fear that Markdown documents are some artisanal file that can only be read by Ulysses.  Because Markdown documents are simply plain text, they can be read and edited by any number of programs. I would say that they may even last longer than a word document of the same age.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Ulysses offers a wide variety of export options; these include text files, markdown, word, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;, and ePub. This is not a program that your work will stay trapped in, unable to leave. I found the export options to be sufficient for a wide variety of uses (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;’s and Word documents being my most common) and the templates they turned into looked&amp;nbsp;fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Book&amp;nbsp;Itself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book itself reads like an enhanced instruction manual; reading free blog posts and slight fiddling with the application will get you 90% of the material in the book. Like with any instruction book, there were some good ideas that I haven&amp;#8217;t even considered, some ideas that I already knew, and some ideas worth exploring. This is a perfect book to give you a start to finish guide about setting up Ulysses. However, if you are experienced with Ulysses, there may not be much new material for you in this&amp;nbsp;book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a structure in the book; from the initial fiddling around with settings to  exporting the finished product, Hewson touches on every step in the process. This presents a great walk through of what writing in Ulysses actually looks like, which I am all&amp;nbsp;for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an inherent beauty within Markdown. Its power is that it gets out of the way with the most important thing being the words on the page. Overall, I had takeaways which I immediately implemented &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it was interesting to see how a fiction writer has his work environment set up. If you are interested in a new, more minimal writing application or have purchased Ulysses but haven&amp;#8217;t done much with it, this book is for&amp;nbsp;you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word may not be able to read a file from 2001, but a markdown file will be good forever. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;

Many models do not do well with NaN data, so dealing with these rows are a critical part of the data science process. Below are four examples of how to drop NaN values from a Pandas&amp;nbsp;Dataframe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;df.dropna()     #This command drops all rows that have any NaN values
``df.dropna(how='all')     #This command drops the rows only if ALL columns are NaN
``df.dropna(thresh=2)   #This command drops the row if it does not have at least two values that are not NaN&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;df.dropna(subset=1)   #This command drops the row only if NaN is in the specific column&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Recently I came across &lt;a href="http://devarea.com/pandas-for-sql-users/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; that is the Rosetta Stone between the two, showing a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; command and showing how to obtain that same result with Pandas.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, here are some select statements translated into a Pandas&amp;nbsp;command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Select * from df where Age &amp;gt; 12&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;df[df['Age']&amp;gt;10]&lt;/code&gt;
Here, the goal is to make a dataframe from a dataframe where age is greater than 10. Pretty&amp;nbsp;straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Select Name, Country  from df where Age &amp;gt; 12&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;dfdf['Age'&amp;gt;10]['Name','Country']&lt;/code&gt;Here, we’re selecting two fields from a dataframe. The first one part is setting the condition (where age is greater than 10) and the second bit shows the fields that we&amp;nbsp;want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something to note is that logical connectors work inside the dataframe, meaning that you can have something like the&amp;nbsp;following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;df[(df['Age']&amp;gt;12) | (df['Height'] &amp;gt; 130)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these Pandas tips will make information selection much more efficient. Python really can be used throughout the data science pipeline, and I look forward to further experimentations with&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While doing research for this post, I didn’t realize is that Pandas has a similar section in their &lt;a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/comparison_with_sql.html"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This event was particularly meaningful to Apple, as it was  the first event to be held in the new Steve Jobs Theater. The news was expected; several leaks before the event made sure there would be no surprises. However, I watched the whole thing and came away with a positive&amp;nbsp;impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation started off with the very touching tribute to Steve Jobs. Tim Cook brought up a sound clip of Steve Jobs discussing how making great products is a way to give back to the world. I thought it was very tastefully done; as a fan of Steve Jobs, I knew that while not perfect, he advanced computing while keeping it humane and understandable for everyone to&amp;nbsp;understand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list was retail. Retail as long been a strength of Apple, and transforming stores to be more of a meeting and hang out space is the next step in luxury retail. Technology has a fundamental communication problem; there&amp;#8217;s often no instruction manual for the products you are given. These stores give Apple a way to teach the less technology savvy how to best use their products. I believe that doubling down on this is a strong move, and bodes well for retaining the less technology savvy members of the&amp;nbsp;population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Watch and Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me the Apple Watch Series 3 and new Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; are incremental improvements. I do not own an Apple watch and this was not due to a lack of cellular in the previous versions. For those that often run or use it to exercise, cellular is a compelling feature. For the rest of us, it is a nice to have. Something to watch here is the battery life; active use of the watch may hit the battery life harder than before due to this cellular&amp;nbsp;radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, 4k and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDR&lt;/span&gt; in the new Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; are nice features, but not a new compelling reason to buy. A problem for Apple here is that all other players are under $100. Trying to convince a buyer to switch from an Amazon Fire Stick to an Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; with a 70 dollar increase in price is a tough sell. Other than that, Apple automatically upgrading all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt; movies to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDR&lt;/span&gt; is a nice touch, along with Prime Video support, in addition to the live sports feature that was demoed. As a millennial cord-cutter, I would love to see Apple advance the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; space. The disparate apps for different content is painful, and I am hoping to be able to get all the content I want by the time I can fit a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; in my apartment.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;iPhone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least are the iPhones that were announced. The announcements were in line with the leaks, meaning that along with the next revision of the iPhone, called iPhone 8 instead of iPhone 7s, we have a high end iPhone called the iPhone X.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The iPhone 8 seems like a typical advancement of the iPhone line; the camera gets slightly better, the token new feature is announced &lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the chips in the phone get a new&amp;nbsp;advancement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireless charging does seem interesting; I am glad to see Apple supporting open standards. On one hand, having these charging pads built into tables is a terrific use case. It seems less appealing when I have to set a phone specifically on a wireless charging pad. The Apple branded wireless charging released next year looks like a great way to be able to charge all Apple products at&amp;nbsp;once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; and machine learning advancements clearly show where Apple believes the future is headed. Being able to build their own silicon puts Apple heads and shoulders above any other company. I think that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; is going to be the &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/apple-moves-into-ar.html"&gt;next stepping stone for Apple and it’s App developers&lt;/a&gt; and look forward to seeing where the space goes from&amp;nbsp;here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;iPhone&amp;nbsp;X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long rumored iPhone X also was released today and looks incredible. The bezels are removed, meaning that the screen fills edge to edge with the exception of a notch in the top. From an industrial design perspective, this phone will set the trend for the next 10 years of the iPhone. However, the increased size of the screen means that the famous home button and Touch &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; are disappearing. To combat this, Apple is introducing Face &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;, the ability to unlock your phone with your face. This feature will make or break the iPhone X; I will be interested to see what the reviews of the feature&amp;nbsp;are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concluding&amp;nbsp;Remarks.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I have a positive impression about Apple’s Keynote. By introducing a halo product &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for the iPhone, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt; should increase across the iPhone line. By removing the Touch &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; from the iPhone X, Apple also inadvertently gave users a reason to pick the old model; there will be no “why am I buying an old iPhone” trepidation, as opposed to when the 5c came&amp;nbsp;out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, solid improvements to the Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; and Apple Watch will be welcomed by users of their products. For myself, I do not feel the desire to upgrade from my iPhone 7. While the iPhone X is definitely the new hotness, I have found that the best thing to do is to give Apple time to improve a new design. I will be interested to see what features catch on and which do&amp;nbsp;not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As jokingly pointed out, something like this would look a lot like cable! &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having read &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/x_man"&gt;John Gruber’s piece&lt;/a&gt; about the name of this iPhone, I thought it would be called the iPhone X instead of the iPhone 10. However, Apple threw a wrench in their plans and stuck with calling it the iPhone 10. What happens in 2 years? I guess that is a problem for future Apple to solve.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, wireless charging. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning something for all iPhones to aspire to. An example is often a supercar made by a car company. Sales are not high, but it shows where the industry is headed. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Below I will lay out an example company that has does not have a data driven decision culture and explain how they can begin using data to make&amp;nbsp;decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are a greeting card company, focusing on luxury greeting cards. The prices are higher than what people are used to paying for a card, but you think the benefits are worth the cost. You have multiple categories of cards, such as birthday and Halloween cards as well as the ability to offer coupons. Currently you have an online store but management is thinking about opening up a retail store and would love insight as to what would be the best location. If I was an analytics manager, where would be the areas that I could apply analytics and immediately see&amp;nbsp;results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stocking&amp;nbsp;Tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there are a number of ways. I would first start a customer profile page, where the customer enter in important dates. By being able to track certain dates customers buy cards for, a follow up email can be sent next year for a card of the same type. In other words, if they buy a birthday card on July 29th, it stands to reason a birthday is coming up and that they will want to buy a birthday card the next year as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would also help with making purchasing decisions in the aggregate. If a large majority of birthday sales happen in the summer months, it would make sense to order more birthday cards than usual. This would help keep shipping times low and customer satisfaction&amp;nbsp;high.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bundling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also start to look at bundling different card types together. In Economics, bundling can be used to maximize producer revenue. Here, I would look at pairing cards that are not top sellers with cards that are, or offering a slight discount to those that buy multiple cards in a&amp;nbsp;pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Examining profit margins per&amp;nbsp;card&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would look at the various profits per card; it stands to reason that if I have a lot of different card types, some cards make more in profit than others. By performing this exercise, the company as a whole can see if expectations match up with&amp;nbsp;reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have these profitability numbers for each card, we can examine if all the cards are profitable to begin with. If a certain type of card is not making money, we can examine why that is and if it is acceptable. Maybe one card is sold at a loss, but drives sales of a more expensive card. Or that this card often appears on social media, meaning that this card is more valuable then first&amp;nbsp;anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Market Basket&amp;nbsp;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we could look at market basket analysis of these cards.  In other words, are some types of cards sold together a large part of the time? If so, maybe that can be a discount that we&amp;nbsp;offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would all be groundwork, in order to make sure that all members of the business are on the same page. We could also look at various shipping costs (does it make sense to ship international/various states?) as well as the value of advertising. Finally, we can A/B test various areas of the website as well as different deals to see if sales increase or&amp;nbsp;not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retail&amp;nbsp;expansion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as retail searching, I would first focus on more standard analysis, trying first to answer the following questions: Is there an area with a lower cost to rent? Do we want to have a store in a high traffic (read: more expensive) area in order to boost awareness? How close are similar stores and do similar stores even exist? One useful model would be to use zip code income as a proxy for wealth, and focus on areas that have a high wealth.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Elasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question that I have is if cost affects sales. If we lower the cost per card by a dollar, does the increase in sales make up for the lost revenue? In economics we would call this an elasticity question, but knowing this answer helps set the optimal price for this good.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could also look at other factors. Do most of our sales come from a specific part of the country? If so, does weather there affect our sales? Does it make sense to open a store or storage facility there to reduce shipping&amp;nbsp;time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we can see that even with a simple retail business, there are a large amount of questions that can be asked and answered by business analytics.I hope this helps show why having a strong grasp on analytics can be crucial for any&amp;nbsp;organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thinking here is that a luxury card is a &lt;em&gt;normal good&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that consumption of this good increases as income increases&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is that if your good isn&amp;#8217;t a necessity, decreasing the cost increases revenue because the increase in sales overall makes up for the loss of revenue per customer, up to a certain point. If the good is a necessity, such as gas or water, increasing the price increases the revenue because the loss of customers is offset by the additional revenue per customer. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I threw the code up &lt;a href="https://github.com/nielsenz/National-Parks-Expander"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt; and the data visualization can be found &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/zach.nielsen#!/vizhome/NationalParkServiceAttendanceAnalysis/NationalParkAttendenceAnalysis"&gt;on Tableau&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first experience with Python came when I took a data scraping class in college. From there, I ignored it for about a year until I picked up a book titled &lt;em&gt;Automate the Boring Stuff&lt;/em&gt;. The book is terrific and details practical applications of programming, which my computer science degree was lacking. From there, I played around a bit with a simple script that &lt;a href="https://github.com/nielsenz/pdf-Combiner"&gt;combines two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then found a problem that I could practice my excel manipulation skills by programming with Python. As someone who has always loved the outdoors, I found an excel spreadsheet that has the attendance for every national park since 1904. In order to best visualize the data, I needed to manipulate the excel document so that it was in the correct format for visualization. I accomplished this by &lt;em&gt;expanding&lt;/em&gt; the dataset. Initially, I looked at a spreadsheet that had the &lt;strong&gt;Years&lt;/strong&gt; on top and the &lt;strong&gt;Parks&lt;/strong&gt; running down the spreadsheet. However, I needed a spreadsheet with three columns: Park, Year, and&amp;nbsp;Attendance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I had a great time writing this program. It was fun experimenting with and getting used to openpyxl and pandas. The meat of the program is in lines 13-27, with two loops to loop through each year per park and then per&amp;nbsp;park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for parks in range(2,376):&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;parkCode = 'B' + str(parks)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;parkNameCode = 'A' + str(parks)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;currentPark = sheet[parkCode].value&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;currentParkName = sheet[parkNameCode].value&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;#And then this should get all the years per park&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;for years in range(3,115):&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;year = sheet.cell(row=1, column=years).value&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;attendance = sheet.cell(row=parks, column=years).value&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;if attendance == None:&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;attendance = 0&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;df2 = pd.DataFrame({"Park Name" : [currentParkName],"Park": [currentPark], "Date" : [year], "Attendance" : [attendance]}, index = [coolindex])&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;frames = [df, df2]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;df = pd.concat(frames)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;coolindex=coolindex+1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a good sign that I now would do things differently. After my first &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/znielsen/analysis-and-prediction-of-student-performance"&gt;data science&lt;/a&gt; kernel on Kaggle, I now have more experience with Pandas and would use it exclusively. Openpyxl gave me the ability to select a cell by the row and column number, which was very&amp;nbsp;useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visualizations with&amp;nbsp;Tableau&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the spreadsheet the way I like it, I can now visualize the data using Tableau. My goal is to have two graphs: one that displayed average attendance versus total attendance and a heat map of the United States showing the national park attendance. This was my first time making a heat map in Tableau and it could have not gone&amp;nbsp;easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attendance versus Average&amp;nbsp;Attendance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first looked at the data, I wondered how the average attendance per park differed from the overall attendance. Were there years that had a high average attendance but low overall attendance? Or as more parks were added to the national parks system, did average attendance decrease? By graphing this, there’s an intuitive way to see if the trends are the same or not. As we can see, there are slight variations but overall the trend lines are the&amp;nbsp;same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one design decision that was interesting to think about was if I should add dual Y axises, putting the two lines on the same graph. I decided against it, because I think that dual axises are misleading. If I tried to synchronize the axises, the average attendance is so much lower than the overall attendance it just looks like a horizontal line near zero. Although hilarious, it’s ultimately useless and that’s why I chose to stick with the two separate&amp;nbsp;graphs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; National Parks Heat&amp;nbsp;Map&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other visualization that I wanted to create was a heat map. For those unaware, a heat map is a type of graph that colors different fields darker depending on the value. Oftentimes a heat map is applied to a spreadsheet with darker values surrounding higher values. For example, if you had a spreadsheet with monthly sales, a darker green would mean a higher value than a lighter&amp;nbsp;green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other place where heat maps are used are to show data on a map. By placing all of the national parks on a map of the United States, the national parks that are darker have more visitors than those which are lighter. It would be fun to look at different parts of the United States and see if there’s any correlations, as well as just see if the visitors move westward as more parks are opened in the&amp;nbsp;west. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat park itself was pretty easy to create. The mapping data was also provided from the park service, and I used a simple join to the data I created with the python file to associate it together in Tableau. From there, I just had one remaining design choice: should the user be allowed to select one year at a time, or should the user be allowed to select multiple years at&amp;nbsp;once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that are unaware, Tableau has a bunch of ways to filter dates. The two that apply here are a singular selection &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or multiple date selection.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Both have pros and cons, the most notable being the multiple selection is messy but more efficient and visa versa. Ultimately, I decided to go with the multiple selection, but I may transfer back to the single use if users are having trouble with the multiple&amp;nbsp;selection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was excellent to get back into the swing of things. Instead of using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; to manipulate the data, I can see how Python fits into a data visualization environment. I could have even graphed the data using Python; however, I wanted to practice my mapping skills in Tableau. I can’t wait to see how this graph looks and what other insights may come from this&amp;nbsp;data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning that the user can select one and only one year.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning that whatever dates the user wants to select can be selected. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#8217;d like to review a book that I have read many times titled &lt;em&gt;Glory Road&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Glory Road &lt;/em&gt; is a science fiction book written by Robert Heinlein. It is the story of a man on a quest; he gets sucked into an adventure, and realizes that that&amp;#8217;s what his life has been missing this whole time. This struggle between a life of adventure and a life of peace gives the book its title: the protagonist is &amp;#8220;walking the glory road.&amp;#8221; To me, this book is one of my favorites because it captures the struggle to find meaning in life as well as the hunt for a purpose. This is a story of finding one&amp;#8217;s place in the world; something we can all relate&amp;nbsp;to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Narrative&amp;nbsp;Arc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book follows a typical arc for a Heinlein science fiction. We find that our protagonist, Oscar, had to enlist in the military because he lacked funds to complete college. From there, we find the book&amp;#8217;s raison d&amp;#8217;etre; he answers a classified ad in the newspaper and starts to explore different cultures with the heroine, Star, and his groom, Rufus. These different cultures and creatures demonstrate the authors command over Science fiction and magic; there are other cultures explored and fantastic creatures to fight. Finally, we have roughly half of the book devoted to what happens after the adventure is complete. To me, this is equally as interesting as what happens before, even though there is less &amp;#8220;action.&amp;#8221; Heinlein has a tendency to wax philosophically and this is in full display during the latter section of the book. I found myself delighfully engaged due to this book having helped to crystallize a fundamental question about life: what is it&amp;nbsp;for?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential turn&amp;nbsp;off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect that may prove distasteful for readers is that it was written in the 60&amp;#8217;s and is a product of its times. There are statements about the differing gender roles that may be distasteful to some; however, I submit that there is still value and truth to be found while reading this book. If this is the type of thing that can ruin a novel for you, I humbly recommend passing and finding a more modern book to&amp;nbsp;read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What it makes me think&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most intoxicated parts about reading is coming back to a book, and finding out if it still has a similar effect on you. I can say that I still rank this book highly in my mind; however, now there are different sections of the book which are more meaningful to me. Initially, I found a quote early on discussing what the hero wants from life to be very impactful; now I relate mostly to the post-adventure portion of the novel. When Oscar discusses the struggle between the sedentary life and a life of adventure, I find myself wondering if I am spending my life in the best&amp;nbsp;way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think that this book is fascinating, both as a case study and as a tool for reflection. As a case study, this book is a perfect example of hero/heroine science fiction written in the 60&amp;#8217;s. Also, this book raises several questions for living a better life such as if people can settle down and what happens when automation destroys a majority of jobs in the upcoming years?&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highly&amp;nbsp;Recommended&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t help thinking about how automation plays into this; a universal income seems lovely, but what happens when humans don&amp;#8217;t have a reason to wake up in the morning. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

The weather has been surprisingly balmy &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I am enjoying all of the new food available to me. &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Now for some articles that I have been&amp;nbsp;reading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://www.marriagekidsandmoney.com/life-after-dave-ramseys-baby-step-7/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; via Twitter, which talks about the best ways to save your money, once you&amp;#8217;ve paid off all of the debt. I am still trying to understand the difference between retirement options, and articles like this help to clarify what the best move&amp;nbsp;is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/iqaluit-amazon-prime-1.4193665"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; talking about the benefits of Amazon Prime to a remote community in Canada. What&amp;#8217;s truly incredible is that Amazon is able to deliver food and other products to a very remote settlement, cheaper than the government. It shows how committed Amazon is to acquiring customers, and how dependanet people are becoming on the internet. It also reminds me of an article I read awhile ago talking about the effects Walmart has when it leaves a&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/you_should_not_force_quit_apps"&gt;John Gruber wrote&lt;/a&gt; a fantastic article talking about why no one should force quit apps on their iPhone. Force quitting an app happens when you double tap the home button and swipe up the apps to make them disappear. Anecdotally, I am seeing this more and more and it’s one of those things that is irritating. I think this may be my Alamo and will start relaying how useless this&amp;nbsp;is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this post &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/24/new-status-symbol-hard-work-spending-ceos"&gt;on work&lt;/a&gt; was a terrific read. Working long hours has become a bragging competition, much to the detriment of workers. I recently found out that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;E.U.&lt;/span&gt; bans working over 45 hours a week which helps remind the workers that they work to live, not live to&amp;nbsp;work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I found &lt;a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/worst-landlord-horror-story/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; talking about the cons of owning a rental property. I find that in the Financial Independence blogosphere, owning property becomes the de facto way to accumulate wealth; keeping negative case studies in mind can temper that urge to go all&amp;nbsp;in. &lt;/p&gt;

Maybe you saw my post on the &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/the-tools-of-a-business-analyst.html#the-tools-of-a-business-analyst"&gt;tools you can use for analysis&lt;/a&gt; but regardless; if you&amp;#8217;re interested in the field yet unclear what that entails, this should help clarify the demands of data&amp;nbsp;science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why&amp;nbsp;Now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, because computers have gotten so much more powerful, we can now collect and process a ton of data.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Unrelated, statistics has a ton of interesting techniques to answer questions like &amp;#8220;does this affect that?&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;can we predict this using these three measures?&amp;#8221; There have been several breakthroughs recently that have increased the accuracy of these&amp;nbsp;techniques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving interesting&amp;nbsp;problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, a bright soul put these two ideas together. Merging these more powerful computers along with new and improved statistical techniques have led to businesses being able to use these resources in a practical manner. Data scientists can improve the bottom line of any business in a variety of&amp;nbsp;ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, say that I am in charge of a grocery store. I have data showing the products that were purchased together and the price that they were purchased at. I can use data science to say &amp;#8220;what happens to the sales of Product B if I lower the  price of Product A?&amp;#8221; Pricing changes are critically important, yet were often based on gut instinct. Now we can test these conclusions and see if they&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;valid.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prediction and&amp;nbsp;variance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, data science is using statistics and computers for prediction and analysis. Part statistician, part computer science, and part business analyst, data science is an exciting field to be entering in today&amp;#8217;s day and&amp;nbsp;age. &lt;/p&gt;

From &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/arkit/"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iOS 11 introduces ARKit, a new framework that allows you to easily create unparalleled augmented reality experiences for iPhone and iPad. By blending digital objects and information with the environment around you, ARKit takes apps beyond the screen, freeing them to interact with the real world in entirely new&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question becomes why Apple would want to get into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt;. Certainly Tim Cook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/10/14581428/apple-tim-cook-ar-vr-product-reveal-interview"&gt;made mention&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; being the next frontier, but it does seem like a strange strategy when &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; consists of holding up a screen to look through. For those who don’t know what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; is, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; is augmented reality. Pokemon Go is probably the most popular example, but there are plenty of examples of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; becoming more and more prevalent.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hardly a revolutionary thought, I think that Apple may be making &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; glasses. This then reveals Apple&amp;#8217;s strategy: they are trying to create content now to be able to benefit them them. One thing that this allows us to do is then skate to where the puck is going and figure out how we can benefit from the upcoming &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; trend. Early on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; will be complementary; it is only later that entire new uses for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; will emerge. While less interesting, we can examine different value propositions for current apps and see how they can use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; transformation to gain a competitive&amp;nbsp;advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I would love to hold up a mapping application like Yelp and be able to see the reviews of businesses around me in real life. This is definitely the future  and would make wandering around the city much more&amp;nbsp;interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; could also be added to any app with a personal profile. I can be at a networking conference and be chatting with a fellow attendee, and have their LinkedIn information pop up. Same for Facebook, or even a dating profile like Tinder or Ok Cupid at a singles only&amp;nbsp;event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt;, games are also much more immersive.  Tower Defense games become more engrossing if I can see the towers placed on my kitchen table. With a game like Minecraft, you will be able to build a monument while exploring your house. Similarly, any fighting games where you can see the characters appear and start to fight drags you into the&amp;nbsp;action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; becomes an incredible value proposition for many types of apps, even in these early days of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; Kit. This will only benefit Apple as more and more apps integrate with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; Kit, giving them a massive content advantage when they release their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;glasses. &lt;/p&gt;

The main takeaway from this episode is Gray saying that by tracking all of your time, you can better understand where it’s all going. Humans are great at fooling themselves, and having accurate measurements about how long tasks take helps when planning out your&amp;nbsp;week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, Gray told a story, where he would tell his wife that he would be on his way home right after he completed a routine task. However, this task would take Gray the rest of the afternoon, which his wife knew! After tracking his time, he now could recognize that his assessment of how long this task would take was wildly inaccurate, and he now could give a better measure of when he would be finished with this&amp;nbsp;task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another focus of this episode is hiring. Both Myke and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGP&lt;/span&gt; Gray are in the process of hiring an employee. By measuring the time specific tasks are taking, Myke and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGP&lt;/span&gt; Gray know how many hours they can pass off to their newly hired employee. I thought it was a very smart way to go about the hiring process. Time tracking will allow you have an accurate measure of the time you can be saving, and is the perfect way to find out if hiring an employee is worth it or&amp;nbsp;not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practical&amp;nbsp;Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, I’ll talk about how I got into time tracking, along with some advantages that I’ve seen from starting to track my time. Because I’m just starting, I didn’t want to get crazy with web automation (using a tool like Toggl and Workflow). I found an app for my iPhone called ATracker &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRO&lt;/span&gt;. This app is exactly what I’m looking for: I can hit a button and start a new&amp;nbsp;timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I set up various timers where I think I spend most of my time.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I tried to go big picture and then give myself room for improvement. By starting immediately, I can find out where my initial plan falls short, and then I can create another timer to cover any activities that I had&amp;nbsp;missed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Productive and Unproductive&amp;nbsp;Split&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tip that I have is to set aside two timers for relaxing: productively and unproductively. A typical situation that I find myself in is that I’ll be writing a blog post, and then I’ll flip to Clash Royale and play a quick match. To me, that is unproductive relaxing; however, if I am watching a movie while eating dinner, that is productive&amp;nbsp;relaxing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I have an unproductive reading timer and a productive reading timer. The unproductive reading consists of science fiction and fantasy. The productive reading could be nonfiction books, news articles, or other readings that&amp;nbsp;educate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sleep&amp;nbsp;Woes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One category that I may remove is the idea of tracking how much sleep I track. The idea of tracking sleep has always been interesting for me; however, I don’t know if this app is the best place to do it. I could see myself breaking that out into a separate app, along with better information on how well I slept that night. Currently my sleep time is (deservedly) overwhelming everything else. For ease of comparison, I may&amp;nbsp;stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear&amp;nbsp;Benefit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One benefit that I am already seeing is that by being honest with myself about tracking time, I already want to limit how much time I’m spending on my goofing off category. It’s so funny how by measuring something, we improve it. By just being aware that all of my time is being tracked, I want to spend it in a ultimately better&amp;nbsp;way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concluding&amp;nbsp;remarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think that time tracking has plenty of uses for all types of people. From office workers to students, everyone can benefit from a more mindful approach on how they are spending their time. I think that the statistics are going to be interesting to see, and I’ll be sure to note any fun visualizations that result from seeing how I spend my time. Overall, the main thing to remember is to not beat yourself up for any mistakes. As an example, I’m still not sure where I should put twitter! No matter what, any improvement is better than no&amp;nbsp;improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always enjoyed reading delayed reviews from people, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d put my own together. I&amp;#8217;ve had the giant iPad Pro for about a year now, and I thought I would go over how it&amp;#8217;s been using it as my only computing device. For reference point, I have a 2011 MacBook Air that I was looking to replace. I was waiting for the new MacBook pros to come out and needed something to tide me over until&amp;nbsp;then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing that drew me in was the pencil for note taking. I&amp;#8217;ve been looking for the perfect combination of digital and analog (read: all the &lt;a href="https://www.livescribe.com"&gt;livescribe pens&lt;/a&gt;) and trying it out in the store is what sold me. I ended up getting the 128 gb with no cellular connection. Because I was majoring in Computer Science, this had have enough memory to handle anything I threw at&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Setup&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two entry requirements were the Smart Keyboard and the Apple Pencil, and I used those exclusively until this week. I recently invested in a Bluetooth keyboard as well as an iPad stand which improves my setup from an ergonomics perspective. I do most of my writing in Ulysses, journal in Day One, program in Pythonista and use Airmail for email. Instapaper is my read it later service of choice, and I use Tweetbot for twitter. Dropbox links everything together. Finally, OneNote is my note taking app of&amp;nbsp;choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Overall&amp;nbsp;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, the whole thing works much better than I thought it would. I&amp;#8217;ll break down some points in more detail below, but I am at roughly 90% task parity as opposed to a computer. The only times I need to break out the laptop are for programming (looking at you&amp;nbsp;R/Stata). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two giant positives for me are taking notes and the lack of overhead. Taking notes on the iPad Pro is the One True Way. The infinite canvas, ability to change pen colors and thickness as well as highlight is truly a game changer. I used to be a black pen and paper person, and I will never go&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I never thought I would be this person, but the lack of overhead with an iPad Pro is freeing. No need to worry about files, extensions, or any of the nonsense. It all (and trust me, I&amp;#8217;m slightly gagging when I say this) just&amp;nbsp;works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The few areas where it can improve are in an ergonomic fashion (the thing is a beast, but the stand and Bluetooth keyboard combo should help with that). I would love to be able to plug this into a giant monitor, but I have no idea how that would even work (and it would also be a distaste ergonomically). In addition,  I would love to do the last 10% of my work on this. R on this thing would be&amp;nbsp;fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say that if I was a big gamer on steam, this would obviously not be tenable. &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Playing Vainglory in 12.9 inches of glory is a fantastic experience. If gaming really is your thing, maybe you should consider an investment in a controller (I hear great things about this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Stratus-Wireless-Gaming-Controller/dp/B00HSB2EZI"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One complaint that I don&amp;#8217;t understand is that Apple should make a custom software for iPad, or even put MacOS on it. I am here to report back and say that not only would such a combination be unwieldy, I would actually be against it. Unless if you have a giant steam library or a specific app keeping you on an x86 system, the switch to an iPad can absolutely be&amp;nbsp;made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess to finish up, I didn&amp;#8217;t think it would go this well. I want to give a special shoutout to Pythonista (if you&amp;#8217;re into coding at all, definitely it check out with StaSh). It&amp;#8217;s such a pleasure to just open an app and have a compete &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt;. Overall, I am looking forward to my iPad only&amp;nbsp;lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;

This is fascinating how you can track Google’s strategy as time progresses. It seems clear that Google is iterating more rapidly than Apple, so I hope that there is something big at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWDC&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second link, I have to &lt;a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/5/24/not-even-wrong-ways-to-dismiss-technology"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to anything Benedict Evans writes. Evans is a very smart guy who thinks a lot about the future. In this piece, he is talking about the urge of people to dismiss new technology. One of my favorite quotes is as follows:
 “William Golding famously said of Hollywood “Nobody knows anything”, but that feels like an abdication of reason and judgement. We should try to do better.”
Yes, we&amp;nbsp;should. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the theme of doing better, a recent study shows that you can become a better performer by &lt;a href="https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/sitting-near-a-high-performer-can-make-you-better-at-your-job"&gt;sitting around other high performers.&lt;/a&gt; Although I was surprised initially, it makes intuitive sense. I’ve always been inspired by other great workers to work harder than&amp;nbsp;before. &lt;/p&gt;

This is from my categorizing student performance, which can be &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/znielsen/analysis-and-prediction-of-student-performance"&gt;seen here&lt;/a&gt; for a more in depth&amp;nbsp;analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While graphing in Seaborn, a cool tip is that you can add the jitter flag which better shows the distribution of data. A graph&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; looks like the following: &lt;code&gt;sns.stripplot(x="Class", y="raisedhands", data=df, jitter=True);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To quickly see the number of observations in each section of a categorical variable, you can write something like this &lt;code&gt;print(df['SectionID'].value\_counts())&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to break a categorical variable into discrete dummy variables, you can write something like&lt;code&gt;df1 = pd.get_dummies(df['gender'])&lt;/code&gt;. This automatically breaks the categorical variable apart, with correct naming and everything. A super useful one-liner in data&amp;nbsp;analysis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, in order to concatenate a data frame to another data frame, you can type something like this &lt;code&gt;df = pd.concat([df, df1, df2, df3], axis=1)&lt;/code&gt;. This will add the columns from df, df1, df2 and df3 to one data frame. I used this trick where df1, df2, and df3 are all dummy variables that I then add to the original df. In my post I note that I’m sure there’s a better way; however, this is what made the most sense to&amp;nbsp;me. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you go. Four Python data science tips that will be useful to me in the future. Here’s hoping that they save the reader some work as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;

They should instead focus on the right way to&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s post is on the technical part of being a business analyst. In my experiences, I have found that being a business analyst requires you to be able to do three&amp;nbsp;things: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;import/manage the&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;manipulate the&amp;nbsp;data &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;visualize the&amp;nbsp;data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools you use to do that depend on both the company and what you are familiar with. For example, if the company is using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; to store their data, it definitely makes sense to learn &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, there is a ton of inherent flexibility with choosing your tools. The most important thing is to be able to accomplish those three tasks that I listed above. Below I&amp;#8217;ll list some examples of how these tools can fit together, if you’re unsure of what to learn&amp;nbsp;first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say you&amp;#8217;re just on your own and want to create a simple heat map with the data already in excel. You&amp;#8217;re pretty savvy with coding in Visual Basic, so all you have to do is google heat map excel and you&amp;#8217;re off to the races. Checking off the three categories, you can manage, manipulate, and visualize the data all in excel. Easy&amp;nbsp;peazy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now let’s expand the above example: maybe you have to get and transform hundreds of observations from 36 different excel sheets. Doable yes, but difficult. Here, it makes sense to use a different, more capable tool. After reading reviews, you decide to download python and use pandas to manage your data (with the terrific read_csv function). The same three categories are covered, but in different ways. Importing the data is accomplished with read_csv, pandas is terrific with manipulating the data, and python has several libraries that let one visualize the&amp;nbsp;data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we can look at a bigger organization. Say that you are working at a company with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; backend that prefers their graphs in Tableau. I’m sure there’s a python package that lets you Connect to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; Database and then import the data into pandas similar to the second example. However, the data may be changed daily. Instead of having to run the same python script every night, the most practical method here may be to build a new table in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; and then connect to that table directly in Tableau. Here the steps are somewhat out of order; you manipulate the data in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;, and then import it and visualize it in&amp;nbsp;Tableau. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is that there are several different tools available for becoming a business analyst, each having their own positives and negatives. What matters more here is the ability to pick the tool that applies best in the situation. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; and tableau is a great one-two punch, but if you need to do serious statistical transformations it is best to learn&amp;nbsp;Python. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to give a recommendation on what people should learn, I would suggest Tableau. Practice finding data in excel spreadsheets and then importing them into Tableau. Once you run into the limitations of Tableau &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I would recommend moving onto Python; it’s the tool that easiest to manage as one person.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, if you are committed to entering the business world, learning &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; may be&amp;nbsp;critical.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the idea of learning all these different tools is slightly terrifying, do not worry. The positive note is that these skills are similar and easily transferable. Dealing with a dataframe in Python with Pandas is similar to manipulating a data set in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;. Graphing follows from this trend; the skills are similar regardless of what tool that you use. It is more important to learn the meta-skills of dealing with data analysis: what’s the best way to graph this, what am I looking to achieve here. The tools are the easy part, it’s the thinking that’s&amp;nbsp;important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if cost is an issue&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the free cost isn’t terrible either. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He recommends bringing a mini fridge to work and stocking it with food to always have food available. As someone who is always in a snack-happy mood, I thought this was a great tip and agree&amp;nbsp;wholeheartedly! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little later on he talks about &lt;a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/06/08/the-joy-of-self-employment/"&gt;the joys of self employment&lt;/a&gt;. I thought his view on the matter was super interesting. The concept has always intrigued me, and reading how he got started made it less terrifying in my&amp;nbsp;mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I of course have to plug my &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/znielsen/analysis-and-prediction-of-student-performance"&gt;first post on Kaggle.&lt;/a&gt; For those that are unaware, Kaggle is a data science website. The main draw is the ability for companies to host competitions, meaning that they supply the data and reward the individual(s) who are best able to solve the problem. I took the side route and made my first workbook  predicting student performance. This dataset is not in a competition, I simply wanted to get a feel for the&amp;nbsp;platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Benefits of&amp;nbsp;Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a way to make your computer smarter. The automation movement is growing, and with apps like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IFTTT&lt;/span&gt;, Zapier, and Workflow, now is a great time to get into the automation&amp;nbsp;movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to get&amp;nbsp;started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, you’ve gotten a slight introduction to automation either through a Macstories post, Workflow being featured on the App Store, or by finally checking out what all of the hype is about. And so you sign up for one of the apps mentioned above. After opening up the homepage/app you immediately get bombarded by tons of different options. “Should I use this app, or maybe I should use this other version? This is popular recipe but doesn’t apply, maybe this automation thing isn’t for me?” I think that this is a big problem with the current automation environment, and I plan on spending the rest of the article discussing how to use automation effectively. I’ll talk about the best way to get started with automation and give some advice on the best way to approach the idea of automation. To keep it consistent, I’ll also be using Zapier for this introduction&amp;nbsp;post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First, do a workflow&amp;nbsp;analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to becoming a successful automation expert is to examine your workflow. What are the tasks that need to get done and where is there dead weight? As an example, imagine that you were a small business owner; you probably have a website with a recommendations and suggestions section as well as email signup link. In addition, you like to send out an email after someone makes a purchase and you also have an overall sales funnel for business to business sales. As far as hobbies go, you’re kind of a running nut. Tracking your runs is something you’d like to start and have been looking to do so for&amp;nbsp;awhile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step would be to examine what apps you currently use and if it’s now time to switch to a more wildly supported application.  To continue the above example, the recommendations/suggestions section could be hardcoded into your website. This could be changed to a specialized form, which means you don’t have to get your hands dirty adjusting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; on your page whenever you need to change the options&amp;nbsp;available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A far as email signups go, you heard about Mailchimp on a podcast forever ago and have been using it ever since, so you’re ahead of the technology curve there. However, in order to add a customer to the recently purchased list, you copy and paste the email from your sales software.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your business to business sales aren’t a huge part of your business (yet), so you’re currently okay tracking this part of your business with a couple excel spreadsheets. Finally, you recently got introduced to this running app Runkeeper on your iPhone and love it. However, you want to add your runs to a spreadsheet for further data&amp;nbsp;manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pain Point&amp;nbsp;Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve gone through some of your business workflows, we can see areas where we can use automation to simplify the process. 
- By changing to a specialized website form builder, we can leave the option open for that to be automated.
- Mailchimp has a Zapier integration, so there is definitely automation potential there. For example, if we can remove the manual cutting and pasting that would be a life saver. 
- If we could find a way to automate Runkeeper to backup all of your runs, that would be&amp;nbsp;magical &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implement One&amp;nbsp;Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve examined some pain points, my advice would be to make one change. By making one change at a time, this will allow you to get your feet wet. Maybe you are unfamiliar with the syntax of Zapier or what to see how seamless this process really&amp;nbsp;is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first change I would make would be to add your runs to a Google sheet. Both Runkeeper and Google sheets are supported by Zapier, and this has minimal impact on your business if you’re unsure of this “automation”&amp;nbsp;trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a plan, you can open up Zapier and begin the creation process. The process is as easy as searching for Runkeeper and then Google sheets. After select the triggers you want, your recipe should be good to go! As easy as that, you’ve automated something. Give it a test run &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and see how it works&amp;nbsp;out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rinse, Wash, and Repeat as&amp;nbsp;necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’re a seasoned automation veteran, you can start automating your other pain points. From here, I would branch to Mailchimp and then the web form and sales funnel. Then it’s just being aware of any pain points that pop up as your business&amp;nbsp;expands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The True Benefits of&amp;nbsp;Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation to me isn’t so much about the time savings.&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It’s mainly about reducing &lt;strong&gt;mental overload&lt;/strong&gt;. That to me is the power of computers. By automating the busy work in my life, I really can focus on doing the work that matters and I avoid wasting time on the stuff that does&amp;nbsp;not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like an animal! &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pun absolutely intended&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which can be substantial&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I’m not sure if I will ever remember the colon after the if statement&amp;nbsp;condition. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same for the for&amp;nbsp;statement &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;openpyxl is great for manipulating for excel&amp;nbsp;spreadsheets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Except if you want to read from one workbook and write to&amp;nbsp;another).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing to a pandas data frame is a delightful intermediate&amp;nbsp;step!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always use the concat method for merging two data&amp;nbsp;frames &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get rid of the first n rows of a data frame, one can drop said rows via the drop head(x)&amp;nbsp;command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which is super useful when the first row used to initialize the data frame is utter&amp;nbsp;gibberish. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging a program is somewhat like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Niels506/status/859946189554421766"&gt;playing a&amp;nbsp;piano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep is key. No problems were ever solved at midnight (or 1,&amp;nbsp;2…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show how useful an electric car can be, I found &lt;a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2016/10/04/so-i-bought-an-electric-car/"&gt;a real life case study&lt;/a&gt; regarding a used Nissan Leaf. The author does a great job of running all of the numbers, and shows how electric cars would take over the world if not for a lack of knowledge regarding their&amp;nbsp;benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that electric cars are the way of the future &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and it’s crazy to see oil companies acknowledge that.

This can be writing your own commands that combine multiple commands, shortening other commands, changing colors, etc. To open up the bash profile, type the following code.
    cd ~
    sudo nano .bash_profile
    //Make changes
    source ~/.bash_profile //resets&amp;nbsp;terminal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just getting starting with frequent terminal usage, so my bash profile isn’t huge. The one command that I found online is a command brewup which updates Homebrew&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  I also found some file searching commands online which are super handy. Next on my add list are commands that make hidden files visible and visa versa. The terminal is an incredibly useful tool, and the bash profile makes it even more useful! So go forth and&amp;nbsp;customize!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know what that is and you don’t code, ignore this completely. If you don’t know what this is and code frequently, it’s a lifesaver!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Read and&amp;nbsp;see!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finals week has had me unable to write much, but I have been coding more frequently. Below are some miscellaneous tech tips that I’ve used in the past week that are worth writing&amp;nbsp;down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to get to the desktop in&amp;nbsp;python3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been programming my way through &lt;a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com"&gt;Automate the Boring Stuff&lt;/a&gt;, a book about how to use python to make the computer more productive. In order to do so, I often have to change directories in my python program to find the files to manipulate in the first place! To do so, I have a little bit of code that will help with that.
    import os
Thing to import that’s used to change directories
    os.getcwd()
Displays the current working directory. I’m still trying to figure out where everything is located on my Mac, and this is a useful debugging tool. 
    os.chdir(“Desktop”)
Method to change the directory. Pretty self explanatory. I often set the files I’m currently working with on my desktop, so this would be how I could change to that&amp;nbsp;directory &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Subl to work on my Mac in the&amp;nbsp;terminal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started to use Sublime Text to write my programs with and I’ve been researching different tips and tricks that make it more useful. I recently found some code that will let me write “subl” in the terminal and have the file pop up in Sublime Text. For example, I could write 
    subl program.py
And program.py pops up in Sublime Text. Super useful. You could also use commands like 
    subl *
And everything in the current directory will pop up in sublime text, which is crazy. The below code worked for me to get it up and running, but I do recommend Stackoverflow if it’s not working.
    sudo rm /usr/local/bin/subl
    sudo ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl&amp;nbsp;/usr/local/bin/subl&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tech tips"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="sublime text"></category></entry><entry><title>The Surprising Commonality between the iPhone and Apple TV</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/the-surprising-commonality-between-the-iphone-and-apple-tv.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-10T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-04-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2017-04-10:/the-surprising-commonality-between-the-iphone-and-apple-tv.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple can’t predict the future and I find that very&amp;nbsp;reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reading the always fantastic &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/"&gt;Stratechery&lt;/a&gt;, I came across a &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/the-ten-year-anniversary-of-the-apple-tv/"&gt;truly excellent post&lt;/a&gt; reflecting on the Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;. What doesn&amp;#8217;t give enough attention is that the Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; was announced at the same time as the iPhone, and yet the two products have completely divergent paths. The iPhone fundamentally changed society, upended entire industries, and created several new&amp;nbsp;ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; on the other hand did none of these things. For a long time it was a hobby product, and as only been revised three times since that initial offering. Like Thompson, I find great solstice in the fact that Jobs didn&amp;#8217;t know what the impact of the iPhone would bring. The future is a vast, unknowable thing and it’s glorious to see that no one can truly predict the future, not even Steve&amp;nbsp;Jobs. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apple"></category><category term="iphone"></category><category term="apple tv"></category><category term="future"></category><category term="steve jobs"></category></entry><entry><title>More on Apple’s Pricing Strategy</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/more-on-apples-pricing-strategy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2017-04-05:/more-on-apples-pricing-strategy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple’s choosing an interesting method to price&amp;nbsp;iPad’s.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Keeping largely in line with my article on &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/do-you-really-need-a-new-macbook-pro.html#do-you-really-need-a-new-macbook-pro"&gt;the new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, Above Avalon has &lt;a href="https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2017/3/29/apple-is-pushing-ipad-like-never-before" title="Above Avalon iPad Pricing Piece"&gt;a piece&lt;/a&gt; regarding Apple’s new pricing strategy. As I discussed, Apple is moving the MacBook Pro higher up the pricing “curve”, positioning the iPad Pro as an entry gadget into the Apple ecosystem. By making the MacBook Pros more expensive, a user has to choose between using an iPad or paying more for the privilege of using a&amp;nbsp;computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t talk about the low end of the iPad market in that piece, but Cybart nails it. We’ve reached peak iPad mini with the release of the 5.5 inch iPhones, and by positioning the 9.7” iPad at a cheaper price Apple is able to make an iPad a much more appealing product. The Average Selling Price (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASP&lt;/span&gt;) remains high because of the much more expensive iPad Pro and the accessories that come with it (such as the Smart Keyboard and pencil). I think that the iPad is in a good place, and Apple has positioned it effectively for the&amp;nbsp;future. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apple"></category><category term="pricing"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="iPad"></category><category term="above avalon"></category></entry><entry><title>Incentives Leading to Fake News</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/incentives-leading-to-fake-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-04-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2017-04-02:/incentives-leading-to-fake-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just another example of applied&amp;nbsp;economics.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was deciding to start my blog, I was thinking about what I would write about. Certainly I wanted to talk about technology, data science, as well as economics. However, I could have scrapped all of those options and wrote fake news&amp;nbsp;instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A true primer on fake&amp;nbsp;news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that are unaware, fake news is exactly what it sounds like; what many do not know is that some websites make their &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/23/503146770/npr-finds-the-head-of-a-covert-fake-news-operation-in-the-suburbs" title="NPR Fake News"&gt;entire living from&lt;/a&gt; the concept.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Indeed, one of the most fascinating pieces I read during this election season featured &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo?utm_term=.jq6GKG7ya#.vi4252rpN"&gt;teens in Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; who ran hundreds of pro-Trump fake news websites to earn a&amp;nbsp;living. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ender’s game speaking&amp;nbsp;truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first came across the idea of fake news when I was reading &lt;strong&gt;Ender’s Game.&lt;/strong&gt; In the novel, Ender’s brother (Peter) and sister (Valentine) start blogs in order to gain influence and prominence on earth. The quote below is &lt;a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/endersgame/section10.rhtml"&gt;from Sparknotes&lt;/a&gt;, showing their initial plan on how they will&amp;nbsp;succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valentine knows that Peter can find peoples fears and manipulate them and that she can persuade people to do what she wants them to do, and realizes that there is much of Peter in her—they both manipulate in their own ways. He has a plan to take over the world. As he explains to her, he will gain power, one way or another. It is in his nature to control. With her help he can rule over something worthwhile. They begin to use the nets to communicate political ideas, Valentine as the radical Demosthenes and Peter as the moderate Locke. Their ideas begin to spread, and Peter has lots of patience.
I find it fascinating that a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game"&gt;fiction book from 1985&lt;/a&gt; predicted the playbook of fake news in the internet era. Say what you will, Orson Scott Card predicted this era of fake news&amp;nbsp;perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bringing Fake News into the modern&amp;nbsp;era&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I bring this up is that I recently came across this &lt;a href="http://www.fakeittomakeitgame.com"&gt;fake news game&lt;/a&gt; and shows the perfect fake news playbook. I found the game utterly fascinating in an examination of incentives. It’s a lot easier to spread untrue articles that pray on fear as opposed to more positive articles.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This results in higher traction, resulting in higher ad revenues. Thus, ad revenue incentives the author to publish fake&amp;nbsp;news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Incentives rule the&amp;nbsp;world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an economist, I think a lot about how incentives guide human behavior. Fake news is one example of how incentives are distorting the overall news industry. The problem is only exacerbated when other mainstream media companies are subject to these same pressures to chase ad revenue, and thus give these fake stories&amp;nbsp;attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fake&amp;nbsp;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, &lt;a href="http://www.fakeittomakeitgame.com"&gt;Fake It to Make It&lt;/a&gt; is a fascinating example of how incentives distort the news industry. I think this game is both fun and shows the danger of fake news. It demonstrates how crucial being an educated news consumer is by  being aware of the incentives of the news&amp;nbsp;publisher. &lt;/p&gt;

In this vein, I came across &lt;a href="https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2017/3/15/the-curious-state-of-apple-product-pricing"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from the fantastic &lt;a href="https://www.aboveavalon.com"&gt;Above Avalon&lt;/a&gt; about how Apple is pricing two of their more recent goods. As Cybart&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Apple pushes deeper into luxury brand territory, the company is making its products more accessible through lower pricing. At $159, Apple is underpricing AirPods. The same can be said for Apple Watch, priced at $269. In just ten years, we have moved from the &amp;#8220;Apple Tax&amp;#8221; days, when Apple was accused of pricing products artificially high, to Apple products being priced below the competition. Apple is using its balance sheet and scale to grab new users, and in the process, redefine&amp;nbsp;luxury.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, excellent analysis and a great example of what pricing looks like in the real&amp;nbsp;world. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apple"></category><category term="pricing"></category><category term="above avalon"></category></entry><entry><title>Why The Kindle is Flawed</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/why-the-kindle-is-flawed.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-25T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-03-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2017-03-25:/why-the-kindle-is-flawed.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thinking about buying a Kindle? You may want to think about these flaws&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite tech products that doesn&amp;#8217;t get enough attention is the Kindle. The e-ink screen along with the small footprint makes it my favorite reading device. I have a Kindle Paperwhite and love it, but because I love it I know the device’s flaws better than&amp;nbsp;anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that bothers me is how painful the store is to navigate. Taps sometimes do not register, the store gets stuck while loading different screens, and in the Recommended for You section I find that the Amazon store recommends books that are not the first entry into a series  Why would I want to buy the fifth book in a series?&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally in the Recommended for You section, I keep browsing books that I have examined and ignored at an earlier time. I would love some way to be able to hide books that are recommended, so that I don’t see them again. Reading the summary of a book repeatedly will not change my opinion on purchasing that&amp;nbsp;book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second area that could be improved would be the grouping of books. Often I want to reread a series, yet if I search for the series title I can’t determine which book is first. Imagine a kindle that automatically grouped books in a series together. I should be able to search “Harry Potter” have have the kindle show me the entire list of Harry Potter books, in&amp;nbsp;order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of grouping, I would love tags while searching my library. Imagine if books were intelligently tagged based on data from the Amazon web store. Oftentimes I know I’d like to read a science fiction book, but I often have a desire to read a specific type of science fiction book. Imagine if I could search for a phrase like “I’d love a science fiction book with aliens and spaceships, with a focus on world building.” That would cut down on the time spent browsing my library, and allow me to spend more time reading.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I would love better interaction with authors. Amazon owns the indie book market, but seems to pay no attention to it. I have to follow authors’ blogs on my own, resulting in a tangled web of extra chapters available, various book release dates stored in my head, as well as any spin offs or other blog posts that could have book related information. Amazon could completely control this market if they could allow authors to post updates to individual series. Imagine opening up one’s kindle and receiving a&amp;nbsp;notification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author X just put out a new sample chapter for the Great Book Series. Would you like to read it now? (In case you forgot, here’s a summary of the first three books that you read)  It’s expected to come out on May 5th! Get excited, and don’t forget to&amp;nbsp;preorder!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would promote user engagement, earning more money for both Amazon and the authors. These updates don’t have to be limited to sample chapters of upcoming novels either; they can be promotions for other work, notifications about book sales from your favorite authors,&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or just general&amp;nbsp;updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential for the Kindle remains high. It is already so good at being a book reader; however, Amazon could really take it into the stratosphere with a few simple changes. This product has a bright future, and I look forward to seeing what Amazon does with it&amp;nbsp;next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d default to always show the first book in a series, or something like that. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Amazon’s Recommended for You section has the basics in place. I can search for just science fiction books or non fiction books that Amazon suggests for me. I’d love it Amazon could take searching a step further, similar to how Netflix recommends movies. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a notification like “We saw you read X by this author; did you know his other series is on sale for 99 cents?” would be worth its weight in gold. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Below are some miscellaneous&amp;nbsp;thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning is key. It’s worth drawing your app out on paper to see how the various parts of the app work together. For example, where should the buttons go? How should everything interact? What should happen in the edge cases? Having an early plan makes development significantly&amp;nbsp;easier.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the market beforehand. I had one promising app idea that I wrote out and was about to start development on. However, I did a quick google search and my app idea had already been on the market for three years! &lt;strong&gt;Having a great app idea is one thing, but having a great app idea first is the crucial&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The act of development is much easier than I have anticipated. I suspect that I built up how difficult app development would be in my head, but it was surprisingly easy to understand. I forgot how pleasant it is to work with a complex language that has prebuilt methods to get information. A google search often finds me a one line method to accomplish what I thought would be a complex task.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Related: for all programming problems it is instrumental to first google these problems to see if an answer already exists.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Coding is building on the work of giants, so why bother reinventing the wheel? Borrow liberally, and spend your time on interesting and novel&amp;nbsp;ideas.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To expand on the above point, I think of a programmer as combining disparate parts to form a new whole. Given all of the code available on the internet, I consider myself a builder with tools available from a number of different sources. Add a little bit from this Stack Overflow post, a little from this blog post, some unique code from yours truly, and then I have a pretty cool&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making money on the App Store is harder than ever. I’ve been following the &lt;a href="https://marco.org/2017/02/20/overcast3"&gt;story of Overcast&lt;/a&gt; and seeing Arment’s struggles and then success to make money shows that monetization is worth thinking&amp;nbsp;about. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good media assets are very important. Any pictures, sounds, etc. will help distinguish your app from the&amp;nbsp;crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this list helps out any new iOS programmers. The main note may be to dive right in. Nothing is ever as terrifying as it&amp;nbsp;appears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to make a button hidden? Just set isHidden = true. Surprisingly simple. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially if these problems are relatively basic in nature. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My opening exposure to sports analytics was reading &lt;em&gt;Moneyball&lt;/em&gt;, and so I hoped for panels&amp;nbsp;of&amp;#8230;Moneyball? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, my expectations were met. While not every panel I went to was filled with insights on how to exploit inefficiencies in the market of baseball, I spent the past two days learning a ton. In no particular order, below are some takeaways from such an excellent&amp;nbsp;conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned something from every panel I attended. Some, such as the Scraping with R presentation were more practical &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, others were more theoretical (such as the Titans of the Sports Industry), but all very&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daryl Morey is a riot in real life. Him and Billy Beane going back and forth is probably my favorite memory from the&amp;nbsp;conference. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morey is also a Renaissance man. Over the conference he could be seen playing with drones, chess, and Super Smash&amp;nbsp;Bros.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lowest hanging fruit for analytics is defense, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFL&lt;/span&gt;, soccer, and hockey.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"&gt;Zach Lowe&lt;/a&gt; made a great point in his panel &lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; about how he doesn&amp;#8217;t need more people to tell him that LeBron James is good at the sport of Basketball. Instead of predicting more obvious things, it&amp;#8217;s worth finding something&amp;nbsp;novel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some smart quotes I heard over the weekend: &amp;#8220;If you&amp;#8217;re not singularly focused on your edge, then what are you doing?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Lack of Personalization in sports is the next great frontier.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Taking the time to do research often pays off.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Crossing the rubicon is execution&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Analytics is like a street of dollar bills. We&amp;#8217;re just reaching down and picking them up.&amp;#8221;&lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;#8220;If you get the opportunity to get an impact player, you go get an impact&amp;nbsp;paper.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to remember the limits of the model. Nate Silver made several great points about having to explain the limits of the model, and make sure you&amp;#8217;re telling stories with the data, not just talking about the&amp;nbsp;data.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I had a blast at my first Sloan conference. I learned a ton and made some great contacts. I look forward to my next one and delving deeper into the analytics&amp;nbsp;culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard about the nflscrapeR package and plan on using it immediately&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And any other sport after that. Lacrosse, golf, etc. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball Don&amp;#8217;t Lie&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then it turns to 50 cent pieces, 25 cents, 10 cents, etc.  &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Predicting the future of a company via an income statement is tougher&amp;nbsp;still.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt; of Snap&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; tomorrow, I thought it would be useful to examine both the Bull and Bear case.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Snap has been a divisive company since the beginning, and never more so after the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564408/000119312517029199/d270216ds1.htm"&gt;S-1 filing document was released&lt;/a&gt;. Below are a few bullet points for why the company could either succeed or&amp;nbsp;fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bull&amp;nbsp;Case:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have executed flawlessly so far. This post by Ben Thompson &lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; describing Snap&amp;#8217;s product strategy (termed &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/snapchats-ladder/"&gt;laddering up&lt;/a&gt;) is worth reading in it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;entirety. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find that they currently have a majority of mindshare with the teen demographic. Much of communication that I see among teens in the United States happens over&amp;nbsp;Snapchat. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The management team maintains all of the voting rights for Snapchat. If you think the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Spiegel"&gt;Evan Spiegal&lt;/a&gt; is a product visionary, his control over Snapchat will not change after the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They&amp;#8217;re cool and continue to innovate.&lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bear&amp;nbsp;Case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The S-1 document shows that Snap has an increasing cost per customer, while revenue per consumer is mostly flat. This puts them in a bad position, making it difficult to turn a&amp;nbsp;profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook is actively trying to crush Snap and has been for awhile. After a failed acquisition attempt, Facebook tried to &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/17/5817996/facebook-slingshot-app-vs-snapchat"&gt;clone Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/9/5700732/facebook-poke-is-dead-and-so-is-facebook-camera"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;. After those attempts failed, Instagram copied the story functionality from Snapchat wholesale, causing &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/slowchat/"&gt;Snapchat&amp;#8217;s growth to crater&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To add insult to injury, Facebook is now &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/25/facebook-stories/"&gt;testing similar functionality&lt;/a&gt; in the Facebook&amp;nbsp;App. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snap&amp;#8217;s entire strategy is based on out maneuvering the competition. If Spiegal somehow misses a trend and someone else can capitalize, thatcould spell doom for the&amp;nbsp;company. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no wrong choice here. On one hand, Spiegal is a one of a kind product visionary and it makes sense to believe that he and Snap will continue to succeed. However, Snap is facing a challenge with Facebook&amp;#8217;s blatant duplication of Snapchat&amp;#8217;s core features. No matter what happens, it will be interesting to see if Snap can succeed or if market forces sink the&amp;nbsp;company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most notably creators of the ubiquitous app Snapchat&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that are unaware, the bull case would be the best case scenario, or reasons to believe that Snapchat will be okay. The bear case is the opposite, which would be the reasons for pessimism.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often cited here, always interesting. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snapchat&amp;#8217;s newest product, &lt;a href="https://www.spectacles.com/"&gt;Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;, has intrigued me from the beginning.  &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Like the name suggests, a transaction cost is a cost that is incurred during the transaction. This could be any middlemen in a&amp;nbsp;transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, take buying a car. Before the internet, you didn&amp;#8217;t know what the true price of a car was, which makes negotiation more difficult. In addition, there were only a few local car stores nearby, so the supply of the cars was limited as well. But once the internet came along, services grew up to take advantage of these costs present, such as Kelly Blue Book and Carmax. Both services reduce the friction present in buying a car and transfer some of what used to be transaction costs to themselves.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If the profits are going to these newly created companies, this means that these profits are not going to the car&amp;nbsp;dealership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One driver of transaction costs is often asymmetrical information. If I&amp;#8217;m a car salesman, I (should) know more about the car than you do. I&amp;#8217;m then able to take advantage of this knowledge in order to squeeze out a slightly higher&amp;nbsp;price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The benefits of the&amp;nbsp;internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet leveled this information advantage. With the iPhone, I now had accessible internet wherever I went. Not sure what the actual cost of a car is? Look it up on Kelly Blue Books. Think the car salesman is being shifty? See how many reviews they have on help. Being able to access information reduced transaction costs and thus increase consumer&amp;nbsp;surplus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lowering of transaction costs can come with unexpected side effects. Take the case of ebooks. When Amazon invented the Kindle and the online bookstore, it was revolutionary because these two interlocking parts removed many of the transaction costs present in publishing a novel. &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If I had written a novel in the pre-Internet era, I would have to acquire an agent, send my manuscript in to the main publishers and hope it gets picked. In short, the gatekeepers &lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; were removed from the situation. Since those costs disappeared, it became (and now is) cheaper to publish a book. All I had to do was push upload! This increased the the supply for&amp;nbsp;books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who replaces the&amp;nbsp;Gatekeepers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although their role has diminished, these gatekeepers provided a valuable service in making sure these books had a uniform quality. If I was buying a book from Barnes and Noble, I could be pretty sure that there wouldn&amp;#8217;t be any misspellings or incorrect grammar. These publishing houses were taking a risk with each book; by paying an advance they had incentives to make sure I was reading a &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; book. Once these gatekeepers disappeared, the quality of each ebook started to vary wildly. This puts more emphasis on finding &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/forging-hephaestus-book-review.html#forging-hephaestus-book-review"&gt;an author&lt;/a&gt; who consistently puts out good work, but that often doesn&amp;#8217;t last. Browsing the Kindle online store, I now face a higher chance of reading a lower quality book. Ratings help somewhat, but the problem still persists. &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consumers are still better&amp;nbsp;off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I perhaps over exaggerate the dangers involved in finding a poor quality book. &lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This reduction in transaction costs has lead to a dramatic boom in consumer surplus, making everyone better off. Countless individuals have earned a living off of the Kindle store, creating music in the digital age or building iPhone apps. I always want to be aware of the trade offs present; economics is nothing&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These companies were able to undercut the dealerships, taking some of the profits and giving the rest to consumers. Because the consumers end up with more then they had previously, it makes sense for them to use these new services.  &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And later Apple&amp;#8217;s iBooks store and publishing platform.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;read: the friction&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the same problem in music. Anybody with a mac can now throw something on SoundCloud, but does that mean any of it is good?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am reminded of a joke regarding &lt;a href="https://medium.com"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, a web publishing service that has done something similar. It&amp;#8217;s called medium because it&amp;#8217;s neither rare nor well done. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Wouldn&amp;#8217;t you be ecstatic? Luckily, there is. It&amp;#8217;s a type of technology that is built into every website, and it&amp;#8217;s called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a little more complicated to set up than Facebook, but it&amp;#8217;s worth it in the long run to have a curated reading list with you, wherever you&amp;nbsp;go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, it&amp;#8217;s pretty easy. All you need is to decide if you want an app that syncs,&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and then pick an app accordingly and you&amp;#8217;re off to the&amp;nbsp;races!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; readers and syncing services out there, so here are the three of the most&amp;nbsp;common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedly.com/i/welcome" title="Feedly Home Page"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.inoreader.com/?lang=en_US"&gt;Inoreader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newsblur.com"&gt;Newsblur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three apps are have their own sync service, which is key for me. While researching this article, I found this post by &lt;a href="https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/"&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; very helpful as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the app downloaded and an account set up, you can begin adding websites. I recommend adding websites that don&amp;#8217;t post too frequently, because it&amp;#8217;s easy to burnout on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;. When I first started using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;, I added several websites that published 10&amp;#8217;s of articles a day. Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve trimmed my feed down so that my unread articles rarely peak 25.  For a deeper dive into the topic, Marco Arment wrote &lt;a href="https://marco.org/2013/03/26/power-of-rss"&gt;a great post&lt;/a&gt; on how to use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; awhile ago and it still holds&amp;nbsp;true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m always wary when people say that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; is dead, or does not have a place in today&amp;#8217;s society. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; is a standard that will be around forever, and the community is thriving. To serve an unfulfilled niche is something to be proud of; I hope to spread awareness of this product and keep this community&amp;nbsp;thriving.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be useful if you have the same application on an iPhone and iPad and want to have the status of both be the same at all times. For example, if the article is read on the iPhone, it&amp;#8217;ll disappear on the iPad. This should also mean that you can read articles on the web, as well. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Drew was kind enough to answer several of my questions and we talked a bit about how publishing online works, especially as an indie author. Some of his answers were surprising to me and he brought up points that I didn&amp;#8217;t even think about. After the interview section, I&amp;#8217;ll also write some bullets of what I took away from the interview. I definitely had fun doing it, and I think you&amp;#8217;ll enjoy it as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To reiterate, I didn&amp;#8217;t receive any financial compensation for this interview or the book review. I did receive an advance copy of &lt;a href="http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/events/vc1"&gt;Forging Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt;. I will take all blame if there&amp;#8217;s a poorly worded question at hand, Drew was great with answering these questions. If you haven&amp;#8217;t checked out the book already, go grab it! If you&amp;#8217;re looking for more pricing goodness, here&amp;#8217;s another podcast &lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ8adl6IcO4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;about similar topics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zach: I don&amp;#8217;t know if you&amp;#8217;ve read my article &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/how-to-price-a-digital-good.html#how-to-price-a-digital-good"&gt;on pricing&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/more-thoughts-on-pricing-a-good.html#more-thoughts-on-pricing-a-good"&gt;or the follow up&lt;/a&gt;) but I&amp;#8217;m interested in figuring out the best price to set for a good, especially goods with a zero marginal cost (aka it doesn&amp;#8217;t cost any more to produce another unit of the good). My first question is about pricing an ebook in the abstract. Do you try and hit a price point? Do quantifiable measures like length factor into the&amp;nbsp;price?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: Pricing in the ebook world is still sort of a new frontier, and a lot of folks are figuring out what does and doesn’t work for them. I’ve seen a lot of books from traditional publishers that looked really promising, but pricing them way too high crippled potential sales. For my own books, most of my works are priced ~$3.99. I’d love to say there’s a grand science behind that, but the truth is it was just what most books were going for when I started in the market, and it seemed like a fair price. I do raise it on books that are exceptionally longer, since those require more cash to bring to market with all the editing, however for the most part I keep around that general area. It seems to be working so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z: Follow up, do you think ebooks are an elastic good? In other words, do you think dropping the price increases additional sales&amp;nbsp;significantly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: Sometimes, sure, if a book is drastically over-priced, however for the most part I think we see big swings in sales when prices drop because that’s usually accompanied by a marketing effort. You pay for ads, maybe a Boobkbub spot, and then drop the price so there’s a sale worth advertising. Below a certain cost threshold, getting noticed is more important than being&amp;nbsp;low-priced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z: In addition, I&amp;#8217;d also like to talk about how this book factors into your overall portfolio. You have a couple of successful series out (Fred, Super Powereds, NPCs), but this is a new self-published book. Does having that freedom of three series let you play around with pricing a bit&amp;nbsp;more?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: In a few places, although as I said above I tend to stick to a general price area so it’s really not that much different. My only price outlier are the Fred books, and since those are produced by a publisher I don’t get to set the price on&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z: You&amp;#8217;ve talked a little about how popularity affects what series you&amp;#8217;re going to work on. I&amp;#8217;d love to hear about how you deal with opportunity costs. Starting a new book is inherently more risky than extending an old&amp;nbsp;property.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: One slight correction, I’ve said that popularity affects the order in which I work on my books, not whether they get worked on at all. Currently I have my writing schedule structured so that I’ll do a book that extends an existing property, which has a good chance of selling, and then I’ll do something a little riskier like Forging Hephaestus, which is a new property. Alternating like that has actually given me more freedom, since it provides a semi-regular income stream while still allowing me to do projects that might not be as commercially&amp;nbsp;successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z: Similar to the last question, I&amp;#8217;d love to hear how you schedule your writing list. I know you publish chapters of Super Powerd&amp;#8217;s (which I eagerly await) every week, but you wake up every day and just focus on one series? Bounce between&amp;nbsp;multiple?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: I have a daily quota I have to meet each weekday, one that varies depending on the project I’m doing. If I’m working on Super Powereds, for example, I do 2 chapters (minimum 1,000 words usually closer to 1,300) each day. If I’m working on a novel, on the other hand, I do 4,000 words per day. Very rarely do I ever bounce between projects in one day though, or even in the same week. I prefer getting deep into a world and doing real work there before moving&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z: I&amp;#8217;d be interested to hear about how you handle marketing and delving in on customer&amp;nbsp;statistics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: Yeah, that would probably be pretty cool… but the truth is I don’t really do any of that. I definitely should, I’ve talked to other authors and there’s a lot to learn there. However, right now I’ve got enough on my plate with the books, so I’d rather spend the time writing. When sales dip, I may have to extend my repertoire of marketing skills, but for now winging it seems to be working&amp;nbsp;okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z: Do you track reviews, and if so, do they&amp;nbsp;matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: From a fiscal and marketing perspective, reviews matter. Since some ad-services require a threshold of reviews to use them, you have to be aware of your numbers, and of course it never hurts to know what books people are liking and buying the most. That’s how I can build a schedule that keeps the rent paid while still letting me explore some of my stranger&amp;nbsp;ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z: In the novel, you show that the lines between heros and villains aren&amp;#8217;t as crystal clear as they should be. Would you be a hero or a&amp;nbsp;villain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew: Oh definitely villain. More villain like in these books than outright monster, but still villain all the way. Sure, heroes get more glory and do cool stuff, however there’s a lot to be said for being able to break a few rules. At the end of the day, villains just have more&amp;nbsp;fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some&amp;nbsp;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the first question, it makes sense intuitively that prices for longer books were higher. However, I had thought that it was because length is something that we can measure.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, I did not even think about editing being a variable cost.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That means the book should be priced higher, due to the variable cost associated with&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the next question, his point about elasticity was interesting as well. A price drop increases sales, but that&amp;#8217;s due to a big marketing push. I bet it&amp;#8217;s hard to tease apart that&amp;nbsp;difference. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout he talks about how his price is pretty consistent at $3.99, which is an incredibly fair price for an ebook, and how he picked it through some market research. As a data driven Economist, I&amp;#8217;d be very interested to see what effect a pricing increase or decrease has on the number of units sold, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to argue with&amp;nbsp;success. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, it&amp;#8217;s great to see that he doesn&amp;#8217;t do a ton of customer or marketing analytics, but is still making a living as an indie author. As a reader I would rather Drew to be writing, and knowing he can still expand is terrific news.&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had thought reviews would be important, but the point about the ad networks was intriguing. I think this also ties into his point about alternating between extending properties and more creative projects. Really a great way to keep track of what projects are doing better than&amp;nbsp;others. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a side note, I wonder how important each 5 star review is? Is it the number of reviews that matter? The overall (or average) rating? Definitely an interesting thesis waiting in the&amp;nbsp;wings. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, I agree with his selection to be a villain. Glory is overrated, and being a villain paints a much more interesting&amp;nbsp;picture.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine storage for iPhones. Higher memory really doesn&amp;#8217;t cost $100 more, but it&amp;#8217;s an easy way to differentiate between products. The larger number is more expensive. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what this says about my writing style, but there you go.  &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to analyze would be a terrific post. I wonder how it would change the writing process at all. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Later, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;T and Sprint followed suit.  The article&amp;nbsp;reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what prompted this about-face that offers not just its first real unlimited plan in over half a decade, but one with prices and perks so generous that T-Mobile, Sprint, and (to a lesser extent) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;T spent the week scrambling to match&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple answer is competition. T-Mobile, for all its underdog nipping at Verizon’s heels, is slowly catching up to Verizon — while it still doesn’t have nearly the customer base, T-Mobile is at the very least putting up a fight with Verizon when it comes to coverage, speed, and&amp;nbsp;reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Verizon’s perceived network advantage is no longer strong enough to keep its best customers on unattractive rate plans and it was forced to respond,” reports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTIG&lt;/span&gt; analyst Walter Piecyk, which, along with T-Mobile announcing a record porting ratio against Verizon in Q1 2017, may explain Verizon’s sudden change in&amp;nbsp;attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This falls in line exactly with competitive supply and demand theory. &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As mobile phone service is becoming more and more homogeneous &lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, service lock-in is falling. Combine that with the ability to look at and compare differing plans via the internet, &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; these factors force prices to fall, benefiting&amp;nbsp;consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also recent reports of Sprint and T-Mobile &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/17/14651640/sprint-t-mobile-merger-2017-fcc-softbank-deutsche-teleko"&gt;restarting merger talks&lt;/a&gt;, which could reverse these trends that we&amp;#8217;re seeing currently. I believe that mobile phones have changed the environment for the better; making sure everyone can access them will be key in the upcoming&amp;nbsp;years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, consumers!&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could make the comment that we&amp;#8217;re really seeing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_competition"&gt;Bertrand Competition&lt;/a&gt; and they would not be wrong; however, I&amp;#8217;m focusing on the competitive demand aspects to make a point about homogeneous services. Regardless, we end up with the same result. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Indie author Drew Hayes has a new book coming out, and put out requests for those who wanted to cover the work in some way. He was kind enough to answer my questions about pricing and being an indie publisher, and I thought I&amp;#8217;d add a book review for some background. Please let me know what you think. As far as disclaimers go, I was provided a review copy of the book early and didn&amp;#8217;t receive any monetary compensation for such a&amp;nbsp;review. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always struggle finding new books to read. The rise of online publishing means that it&amp;#8217;s easier to create books, but unfortunately this implies a lower average quality per book.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This means that finding an author who puts out great material on a regular basis is like striking the&amp;nbsp;lottery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, Drew Hayes is one of those authors. I started off with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, then Pears and Perils, and then moved on to his magnum opus, Super Powereds. For those that are unaware, Super Powereds is originally a serial online about students going to a super hero college.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Once each school year is completed, Hayes publishes all of the chapters for that year in a book and sells it wherever one buys such things. The world the characters inhabit is complex, lacking the sharp moral divide that we expect from our marvel-based&amp;nbsp;media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forging Hephaestus&lt;/em&gt;, Hayes most recent work, is no different in this respect. Although the protagonist now plays for the Villain side, the world is similar to that of Super Powereds - complex, with interesting characters and fascinating super powers. It&amp;#8217;s safe to say that if you enjoy Super Powereds, you&amp;#8217;ll enjoy &lt;em&gt;Forging Hephaestus&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our protagonist in this book is Tori Rivas. At the beginning of the story, she is a small time thief who gets caught. Yet instead of imprisonment, she is taught how to use her powers in a more effective manner. Bigger truths about the world are revealed to her, there are fights with super powers and it&amp;#8217;s generally a good time. I found that I cared about her and her development. Watching the relationships between all the characters grow was satisfying in a way that made me feel that they would be fun to hang out with. This book doesn&amp;#8217;t break any new ground, with all the typical tropes present one could expect.&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Hayes does execute these in a skillful way, leading to an engaging&amp;nbsp;storyline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On other notable aspect of this book is its length. There is enough material in here for two books and I appreciate the story building that goes on. The book ebbs and flows in a way that brings me deeper into the storyline, rather than being distanced by the traditional story narrative.&lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I am glad that he didn&amp;#8217;t split this into two books; the true buildup comes at the very end. In the last 20 pages, Hayes ties all of the storylines together in a satisfying way, while keeping the book open for the next entry into the&amp;nbsp;series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that have read Hayes before knows exactly what they&amp;#8217;re getting into; snappy dialogue, believable characters, excellent world building, as well as great action. I&amp;#8217;m excited for the next book in the series; considering that this book hasn&amp;#8217;t officially been released, I think that&amp;#8217;s quite an accomplishment. For those that haven&amp;#8217;t read Hayes before, I think going onto his website and reading Super Powereds is a great start to see if you enjoy his writing. If you do (and I have a strong inkling that you will) I think this book would make a great next read. If you can&amp;#8217;t tell by now, I thought the book was great. His books can be found on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Forging-Hephaestus-Villains-Code-Hayes/dp/1515912965" title="Amazon Link"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or his &lt;a href="http://www.drewhayesnovels.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strongly&amp;nbsp;Recommended.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think if J.K Rowling was the only person who could publish. Books would be pretty good, right? But then add in four random strangers. The overall quality would decrease. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gross simplification, but it is fantastic. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a particular fondness for &amp;#8220;character that travels between parallel universes to observe unique storylines&amp;#8221;  &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We solved it with&amp;nbsp;Economics.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With a holiday to either celebrate one&amp;#8217;s love or corporate consumerism, &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  I thought it would be fun to try and model the value of surprising a significant other with a gift. Below, you can see the model with a key on the side to demonstrate how to interpret this&amp;nbsp;image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Valentines" src="http://zachnielsen.org/images/Valentines.png" title="Valentine's Day Game Theory"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper left triangle per box matches the value Person A receives from the action in the respective column, and the lower right triangle matches the action Person B on the left performs. These two people can either surprise or not surprise their partner. I calculated each number using a complex formula&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and I took the overall value to be an average of what you feel towards yourself and your opinion for the other person.&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the square in the top left means that both Person A and Person B surprise each other with a gift. This does not change their self opinion but grows their opinion of the other person by five units. This means that the overall value that they gain from that action is 2.5, which we&amp;#8217;ll use in a&amp;nbsp;minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve talked about &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/a-fivethirtyeight-riddler-attempt.html"&gt;Nash Equilibrium before&lt;/a&gt;, but the main idea is that the game is at equilibrium when each player can&amp;#8217;t make a move to better him or her self, no matter what the other person does. We can find that by limiting one person&amp;#8217;s move and then figuring out what the other player will do in response to that&amp;nbsp;action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, say that Person B surprises Person A with a gift. By covering the bottom row (not surprise) and comparing the numbers in the top left triangle in each column, we can see that Person A receives a higher value when surprising Person B with a gift. Similarly, if we move down a row, we can see that even when Person B doesn&amp;#8217;t surprise Person A with a gift, Person A receives a higher number by surprising Person B (with a value of 1 as opposed to -.5)&lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusing? Somewhat circular? All true! But by using the same technique to figure out the optimal move for Person B (spoiler: we end up with the same result) it turns out that we do have a Nash Equilibrium that one should always surprise one&amp;#8217;s significant other on Valentine&amp;#8217;s Day.&lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of these values can be changed depending on what you think is more accurate. Maybe person A and B both rate their self opinion more crucial than their opinion of the other person, in which case the mean can be changed to a weighted mean. Or a -3 can be changed to a -45, etc. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Who&amp;nbsp;knew!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When studying microeconomics, a typical question for a monoploy proceeds as follows: What is the best way to capture all the consumer surplus?&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Consumer Surplus" src="http://zachnielsen.org/images/ConsumerSurplus.png" title="Illustration of Consumer Surplus"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to capturing this surplus can be done in a couple of ways. Ideally, as a producer I could know what each person was willing to pay as soon as they walked in to my store. That way, all I had to do was to set the price of my good equal to that amount, and take all of the consumer surplus as&amp;nbsp;profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that isn&amp;#8217;t possible for a variety of reasons (yet).  By being forced to set the same price for each customer, there&amp;#8217;s an inefficiency that exists. Customer 1 may be willing to pay 100 dollars, but customer 2 may only be willing to pay 80. By setting my price as 80, I end up with more profits than if I set the price to be 100&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, yet I&amp;#8217;m still leaving money on the table for customer 1. The best we can do  maximize profits is to approximate, and different methods of price discrimination exist to help solve that&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One method of approximation is to set the cost of one unit equal to it&amp;#8217;s marginal cost, and then take out the consumer surplus through some other sort of fee. Continuing with the above example, I can set the price equal to its marginal cost (say 20) and then force consumers to pay off the total consumer surplus. This can be done either by bundling, where the bundle is priced at the amount of the consumer surplus, or more commonly is through some sort of up front fee. In the vein of Costco and Sam&amp;#8217;s Club, this technique is popular among wholesalers. In a real life example, we can take Costco. In a Costco, the goods are priced at marginal cost, but there is an entrance fee in the form of a membership to access these cheaper&amp;nbsp;goods.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example that struck me was an Open Bar. If we take the cost of the alcohol as fixed&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as well as noting that the supply of labor is fixed for that night&lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, then the marginal cost of an alcoholic beverage is zero. By selling the option of an Open Bar, the bar is attempting to capture all of the relevant consumer surplus ahead of time as opposed to taking it out piecemeal, drink by drink. The cost of the Open Bar most likely outweighs what one would have spent on alcohol to begin with; the bar ends up walking away with more money then it would have received otherwise.&lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s always fascinating to see pricing techniques being practiced outside of the classroom. The effectiveness of these techniques can be seen simply by how far they spread and how popular they&amp;nbsp;become. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer surplus is defined as the area above the cost curve and below the demand curve, or what consumers are willing to pay. See the graph below for an example. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By selling to customer 1, I make 100. By selling to both customers for 80, I receive 160 in profits. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a contract where the alcohol is ordered weeks in advance. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t hire another bartender the night of an event&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can imagine all you can eat sushi and buffets function in a similar fashion. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For those that are unaware, Arment is an iOS developer and here he both provides his own iOS app sales data and well as linking to other posts with similar data. The data he provides is valuable, and it is worth going through old data to see what lessons we can draw from his real life&amp;nbsp;experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Data and&amp;nbsp;Conclusions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main conclusion that can be seen is that the first week after launch is when sales are at their peak. This makes sense logically, as marketing and press highest level.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, your biggest fans are waiting to purchase whatever you put out.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there begins the difficult task of convincing more indifferent people to try (and buy) your product.&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This can be seen in &lt;a href="http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/93118460565/a-candid-look-at-unreads-first-year" title="Unread's Sales Numbers"&gt;Jared Sinclair&amp;#8217;s post&lt;/a&gt; about his app sales at the time&lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Unread. In his post, he makes the explicit statement that during the first week, &amp;#8220;Demand for your app will likely never be higher&amp;nbsp;again.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Qualifiers and Lessons&amp;nbsp;Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more recent data to look at as well, and the lessons it shows are the same. &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@genadyo/my-first-3-months-on-the-imessage-app-store-300044e6a15"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an example of an iMessage app, where most of the sales were immediately after the app was launched.&lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Another interesting piece came from &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2016/08/vesper_adieu"&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt; on the end of Vesper, a notes app created by John Gruber, Brent Simmons and Dave Wiskus. It was a very interesting piece on what they would do differently. Gruber makes a great point on how luck plays a role in any venture; however, the market for a paid for iOS app is changing as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the main lesson to learn though comes from &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/pleco-building-business-just-app/"&gt;Stratechery,&lt;/a&gt; with regards to Sinclair&amp;#8217;s app. Thompson speaks to how the marginal cost for any app is zero; without meaningful differentiation, this implies that the cost of an app will fall to zero. Design for the sake of design won&amp;#8217;t earn you any sales, it is key to have a tangible reason on why someone will buy your&amp;nbsp;app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another lesson that was hit repeatedly was how crucial it is to have some sort of recurring revenue. Gruber mentions how they should have created a Mac app and charged for a sync service; many popular apps now follow a similar phenomenon&lt;sup id="fnref-6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Enterprise software has leaned towards a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAAS&lt;/span&gt; (software as a service) model for awhile. Some sort of recurring revenue will now be necessary to survive in the market. With prices falling, it becomes unsustainable to sell an app at a fixed&amp;nbsp;price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the main lesson is that without meaningful differentiation, price falls to marginal cost. Although the initial tendency to enter into a market may be driven by idealistic standards, it is still crucial to look at a market to determine the viability of entering. With meaningful differentiation though, the opportunities are&amp;nbsp;endless.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

This is a pretty incredible advancement, as poker is a much more complex game for computers to&amp;nbsp;learn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poker is a game where all of the information is not known. Players hands are hidden from each other, which makes the algorithm more complex. This type of game differs to a game like chess, where the state of the board is known to both players of the game. Because there is no hidden information, the optimal move can be found much&amp;nbsp;quicker.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is further evidence that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; revolution is coming, and will take over in realms that were often thought to be exclusive to human. Reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Second-Machine-Age-Prosperity-Technologies/dp/0393350649" title="Amazon link"&gt;The Second Machine Age&lt;/a&gt; made the case that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; will get better at a faster rate.

Getting and playing with data is one of the tenets of being a data scientist/economist. However, it is difficult to know how to proceed an open, entirely new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;. Below is a checklist for me (and all of, truly) to follow in order to maintain scientific&amp;nbsp;integrity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a hypothesis to test
    Whenever I have a new dataset, my immediate desire is to start running regressions on any combination of variables. However, I now realize that is the wrong way to begin. I should first have a hypothesis that I want to test, and then find data that can help me find a solution. The scientific method that everyone learned in middle school is actually useful, who would have&amp;nbsp;thought?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for any outliers
    Now that you have a hypothesis and data that can be used to determine if the hypothesis is true, the next step would be to examine the data and make sure it is relatively sound. Normally this can be accomplished by noting any outliers, and seeing if they can be removed or not. &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, I like to check the spread of the data, establishing a baseline for each variable in my head. Does the mean of variable x seem higher than normal? That is worth examining in closer&amp;nbsp;detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the regression
    After noting the hypothesis and eliminating any possible outliers, it is now time to run the actual regression. If the results are statistically significant, then the mission is complete On the other hand, if the results are less than spectacular then it is time to change your hypothesis. What could be better? Is there any information that can be added/removed that would lead to a working conclusion? After a new hypothesis is made, the cycle can start&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated before, whenever I receive new data, I have a tendency to run regressions without a thought as to what the results mean or the quality of the results. Following this list will allow me to approach the problem in a more scientific way, leading to better analysis and more interesting&amp;nbsp;results.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a statistics class one time, and the professor asks us if we knew when it was acceptable to remove outliers. After staring in silence for a bit, the professor remarked that it is when another piece of data contradicts the outlier&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, getting the age of all the students in the classroom, the mean would be around 21. However, say there was an outlier of 67. Delving deeper into that entry, we find out that is actually the teacher&amp;#8217;s age. Then it would be permissible to remove that entry. However, that entry could also be legal, if that was a returning student. This explanation continues to be the best way to determine outliers.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssc install outreg&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;regress yx+z&lt;/code&gt;

In the United States (and I&amp;#8217;m told in most of the world), there is the idea of the&lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_resolution" title="Wikipedia"&gt;New Year&amp;#8217;s Resolution&lt;/a&gt; which is setting a goal at the start of the new year in order to improve as an individual during the next 365&amp;nbsp;days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are three ideas that I&amp;#8217;ve gathered from my readings on what makes a good goal. I write them as a reminder to myself, understanding that practical goal setting is half of the&amp;nbsp;battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure the goal is measurable. 
    Goals, like life, need to have a way to determine if success has been met. Want to exercise more is not a good New Years Resolution; however, wanting to run three times a week is. In the second example, there is an easy way to determine if success has been met unlike the first goal which is nebulous in&amp;nbsp;nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, perhaps one&amp;#8217;s desire is to lose weight. Stupendous! However, what does that mean? Do you want to lose one pound? 10 pounds? Over the year/next three months? These are all valid options, and it&amp;#8217;s up to you to measure what success in this case looks&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track the results.
    Now that you have a definable goal, it is important to track your progress in achieving that goal. There are many possible methods for doing so, including paper and pen, an iPhone app, or a giant wall calendar. Being able to determine success is a crucial component of goal&amp;nbsp;setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if my goal was to lose weight, but did not know my weight before starting the resolution. Maybe I cut soda out of my diet, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure if any change occurred. Instead of setting oneself up for failure, having a start point and end point change the game&amp;nbsp;dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t try to do too much. 
    Finally, the last piece of advice I&amp;#8217;ve gathered is to not try and do too much with your goal setting. For example, while declaring New Years resolutions I may be trying to eat healthier, starting to work out as well as wanting to start a blog. These three goals are all large endeavors. It is more useful to focus on one at a time to create the habit before moving on to the next&amp;nbsp;resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the three tools that I&amp;#8217;ve found help make goal setting successful. By clarifying the goal, tracking the result and not doing too much, this makes the goal both more practical and achievable. Using these techniques, it is far more likely that these goals will stick, making 2017 a year for the record&amp;nbsp;books. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="New Years Resolutions"></category><category term="NYE"></category><category term="goals"></category><category term="guides"></category></entry><entry><title>2016 Announcements</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/end-of-2016.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-12-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-12-16:/end-of-2016.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A plan for the near future to figure out the far&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My plan is for this blog to be dark the rest of December.

As I&amp;#8217;ve recently been reading about game theory, I thought it would be interesting to work through the problem and see what I come up&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules of the game are as follows: there are two countries with a military strength that is a random uniform number&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; between 0 and 1. Each country only knows their strength, and these two countries can choose to either declare war or peace. If either country chooses war, the two countries enter into war with the higher strength country obtaining the wealth of the two countries. If both countries choose peace, then they remain with their wealth. Each country starts with a wealth of 1 trillion dollars. The question now is to solve the game. What is the best move for each&amp;nbsp;country?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting&amp;nbsp;Nashty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first instance of the game is where the moves are made simultaneously&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In order to find the &amp;#8220;answer&amp;#8221; to the game, I often pick a strategy and play out the game with that strategy to see what happens&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So assume that Country A chooses to declare war whenever it&amp;#8217;s strength is above .5 &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Because each country is playing the same game, this means that they both follow this rule initially. However, it makes sense for Country B to lower the threshold to .25 (half of the original value). Now you&amp;#8217;re probably wondering how this makes sense. If A&amp;#8217;s strength is above .5, it will always declare war and Country B has to fight no matter what. On the other hand, say A&amp;#8217;s strength is below the .5 threshold. With Country B lowering the threshold necessary to declare war, it will win half of the time and lose half of the time, making a net gain&lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! Say Country A also employs an economist well versed in game theory and this economist predicts what Country B will do. Country A will then lower their threshold to .125 (half of .25) for the exact same reason! This arms race will continue until the threshold for each country is at zero, and each country declares war. Thus, the best move&lt;sup id="fnref-6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is to have each country always declare&amp;nbsp;war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the game shifts to a version where Country A acts first, and then Country B acts, not a lot changes. If Country A declares peace, Country B knows that is a sign of weakness and will therefore declare war&lt;sup id="fnref-7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If the payout of winning the war is increased, all it means is that war will be more valuable and thus will be declared more often as well. Thus, war will always be declared no matter&amp;nbsp;what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In human speak, there&amp;#8217;s a equally random chance it&amp;#8217;ll be any decimal. If the decimals make it tough to understand, just make it any number between 0 and 10.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning that if I&amp;#8217;m Country A, I don&amp;#8217;t know Country B&amp;#8217;s move&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My optimal strategy for solving game theory, if you will.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected utility of declaring war says that it makes sense to declare war whenever the strength of a country is above .5. In other words, the country will declare war when it expects to earn more money from war than from peace. With a strength of .5, the country will be indifferent between war and peace. It earns 1 trillion if peace holds, and it expects to win the war 50% of the time. .5 multiplied by 2 trillion plus .5 multiplied by zero is 1 trillion. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, we call indifference a win. Makes the math easier.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nash Equilibrium! &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Country A declares war, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter what Country B does regardless.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In theme parks such as Disneyland, certain rides (splash mountain, etc) have a camera that automatically takes a picture of you during the ride. Disney also has several paid photographers walking around the park to take photos at certain&amp;nbsp;points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Disney, these photos probably aren&amp;#8217;t a huge money maker. I can&amp;#8217;t imagine that the cost of the photos pays for much more than the wages of the photographers, or even drives park revenue in a noticeable&amp;nbsp;way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the photos actually worth to the&amp;nbsp;company?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photos are interesting because of due to the multiple reasons for selling them. Currently, Disney is raking in huge margins. A relic of the pre iPhone age, a printed 5 by 7 inch photo can be around twenty dollars, which is an incredibly high price. To me, photos are an elastic good in that I&amp;#8217;m not willing to pay that high of a price for a photo, even if the photo does capture an excellent memory.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Similarly, instead of having a professional Disney photographers take my photo, I&amp;#8217;ve achieved similar results by asking a stranger to take my photo. To me, the difference is neglible. &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is some inherent value to the photo as well. If there is a photo prominently displayed in the household, it&amp;#8217;s 1. great marketing but 2. helps to remind the family of the great memories they&amp;nbsp;had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the photo is not without value.  Photos displayed are often great marketing tools, both by creating a halo effect by reminding the family of the great time they had, but also sparking conversations if people come to visit. Companies spend their whole marketing budgets on gaining mindshare; photos are an incredibly easy way to do&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Proposal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thesis is this: Photos are an elastic good, and the high price are sunk costs from a previous generation. Photos should instead be seen as a marketing tool instead of a revenue generator. By lowering the price to something nominal (five dollars, say) more photos will be bought. The photos will then explode into homes everywhere, raising brand&amp;nbsp;awareness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For smaller companies, the question becomes more complicated. The photos sold could very well make up a significant portion of revenue. In this case, the decision would have to be made on a case by case basis. Photos could very well be an elastic good, and lowering the price could result in an overall increase in revenue. On the other hand, photos could also be inelastic for a smaller company&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, where decreasing price would decrease revenue as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there is nothing worse coming off a ride, seeing an excellent photo and then feeling your stomach drop after seeing the high price of that photo. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I&amp;#8217;ve often come off of rides that takes the photo while riding, and have seen people taking photos of the screen the photo is displayed upon. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a use of props, say. The company has a built in advantage to their photos that consumers are unable to replicate.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Movie studios, video game companies, and venture funds are all examples of industries that rely on outsized returns on a few properties to generate a majority of their profits. While looking for each &amp;#8220;blockbuster&amp;#8221; losses are generated on bets that don&amp;#8217;t pan&amp;nbsp;out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are the companies that focus on selling millions of units and getting a little bit of money from every sale. Examples for this type of business include clothing, retail, and running ads on a website. These are all ideas where money is made based on the idea of scale or reach. By getting a small amount from as many people as possible, the goal is to receive enough nickels and dimes from everyone to make a&amp;nbsp;fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each side has its own pros and cons. For a blockbuster industry, it&amp;#8217;s important to accept that you&amp;#8217;ll most likely be losing money on a majority of deals. For venture funds, I&amp;#8217;ve heard numbers ranging from &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/729876612846493696"&gt;half&lt;/a&gt; to&lt;a href="http://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html"&gt;80%&lt;/a&gt;, which can be hard to swallow for many. However, when that blockbuster finally hits, the rewards are&amp;nbsp;otherworldly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you&amp;#8217;re a scale business you can rest easy knowing that you&amp;#8217;re making money on every unit sold. However, you&amp;#8217;ll never get that 10X return that can be common in a blockbuster industry. In addition, you&amp;#8217;ll be at the risk of being commoditized. &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/abstraction-as-a-way-of-life.html" title="Abstraction article"&gt;Abstraction is the way of the world&lt;/a&gt;, and it is especially true in retail. From Sears came Walmart, and now we have Amazon. Notice newspapers: the money is falling out of the industry because the internet does what they do&amp;nbsp;better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure which option I prefer. Each is optimized for it&amp;#8217;s specific field; predicting what startup will generate those 10x returns is neigh impossible, thus it&amp;#8217;s built on making lots of bets. Trying to find a series of small yet profitable investments doesn&amp;#8217;t fit with how the business is run. Similarly, there are some clothing companies that focus on making outsized returns &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but clothing and style often aren&amp;#8217;t defensible. Is buying a four hundred dollar shirt worth it when I can buy a similar shirt for a tenth of the cost? The type of business follows the incentives of the&amp;nbsp;industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also important to realize what type of company you&amp;#8217;re currently in, and optimize accordingly. If you&amp;#8217;re in a scale based business, focus on decreasing price to increase revenue. Meanwhile, if you&amp;#8217;re in a blockbuster business, focus on finding the blockbuster. Don&amp;#8217;t hang out in the middle, scoot to either side of the bell&amp;nbsp;curve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to make the argument that abstraction and simplification are pervasive aspects of our society. In other words, things get easier over time. While there are some examples of how this doesn&amp;#8217;t hold up (makeup looks as incomprehensible to me as it would in the Victorian era) there are many more examples of this theory holding&amp;nbsp;true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From fistacuffs to Death Tubes to&amp;nbsp;gustar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my first example, I&amp;#8217;d like to bring up fighting and general warefare. Fighting went from something that took years to master &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to using a bow and arrow &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to rifles and now drone strikes. Someone in a chair halfway across the world can cause the same amount of damage as a medieval horde. In a similar case, modern basic training for infantry in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Army is 10 weeks, and yet these soldiers today are more efficient and well equipped than those in the&amp;nbsp;past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar case can be made with languages. As background, Spanish has three possible endings for verbs: -ar, -er, and -ir. The way the verbs get conjugated depend on the ending of the verb &amp;#8212; we play has an ending of -amos, but we live ends in -imos. This is because the infinitive verbs respectively end in -ar and -ir. &lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now contrast this with latin. Latin has &lt;a href="http://bencrowder.net/design/latin/conjugation-charts/" title="Conjugation chart"&gt;five possible endings&lt;/a&gt; and is significantly tougher to memorize than Spanish. French and Italian, more modern languages descended from Latin also have three endings. Additionally, the pervasiveness of English culture has led to a explosion of English &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword"&gt;loan words&lt;/a&gt; simplifying language even further. Twitter and tweeting are universal. &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sorry, this is not the computing language you&amp;#8217;re looking for: Please look for more&amp;nbsp;abstraction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers too have been following this same path. Initially, computers started out as logic gates: from there, they advanced to adding machines with &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era"&gt;punch cards&lt;/a&gt; for data input. After that, programming languages developed: Assembly, C, and then many others &lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Interacting with these computing devices also became easier. From the command line came the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref-6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which opened up computing to the masses. A visual metaphor made computing easier and more accessible to everyone. I could now double click on a folder and see the file pop up, instead of having to explain the terminal command &lt;sup id="fnref-7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A cell phone in every&amp;nbsp;pocket&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the computer abstraction story isn&amp;#8217;t done yet. Smartphones and tablets do away with much of the other friction that comes with using a computer. Who needs a file system when the data you need is right there, whenever you need it? No need to update the virus protection, navigate a folder hierarchy, or update drivers: phones and tablets are simply easier to use &lt;sup id="fnref-8"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-8"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Smartphones are the first and only computers for a majority of the world&amp;#8217;s population, due (in part) to the fact that friction is abstracted away. &lt;sup id="fnref-9"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;point?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway is understanding that technological abstraction removes friction. Future innovations show this as well: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VR&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR&lt;/span&gt; will make interacting with menus a thing of the past. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; assistants and self driving cars are both examples of a difficult thing becoming easier. In order to predict the future, look at the points of friction and imagine those disappearing. That will probably be the direction that the future&amp;nbsp;heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sword fighting and hand to hand combat being obvious examples here.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which can be taught in months, if not quicker&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinitive verbs can be thought of a verbs in a base state: to play, to run. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I was taught that the Spanish verb for to tweet is tweetar. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C is the programming language that other programming languages are written in. Also, C is the forefather in a lot of ways. C++  was built to improve upon C&amp;#8217;s faults. Python abstracts all of the messiness away; &amp;#8220;dangerous&amp;#8221; behavior (such as pointers) just goes away. Whole errors of bugs just disappear.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aka the desktop&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not coincidentally, there was then &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3357701/Bill-Gatess-dream-A-computer-in-every-home.html"&gt;a computer in every home&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromebook&amp;#8217;s recent increase in popularity speaks to this as well. Schools don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about maintenance. The extra benefits in cost and ease of use add more reasons why this is a viable purchase.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-8" title="Jump back to footnote 8 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-9"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d argue that a persistent 4G connection helps too. A dell with an ethernet connection is unsustainable in Algeria. More useful work can be done with an Android phone and a data connection. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-9" title="Jump back to footnote 9 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Primarily, there are several terrible teams this season and a lack of an apparent super team. In addition, there may be too many games of football being played, resulting in football apathy&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Finally, the concussion problem being ever present may also be a concern to some&amp;nbsp;viewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have heard many solutions about how to fix this dilemma. Some of these solutions include removing the Thursday Night games completely, focus on streaming the games to millennials as well as implementing rule changes to make the game more palpable to watch. Though these solutions would no doubt benefit the game, I would like to add my own solution. My idea is simple yet effective: simply take away a quarter of play. This would make the format of the game similar to hockey, in that there would be three periods with two &amp;#8220;halftime&amp;#8221; breaks separating each period. This approach has several benefits that would make the game more interesting, increasing ratings across the&amp;nbsp;board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFL&lt;/span&gt; football game, endings are simply the most notable part of the game. Play during the middle five minutes are often forgettable. On the other hand, play during the last five minutes of each half are often remarkable. This is due to the increased pace of play as teams try and beat the clock. This hurry up offense is when football is at it&amp;#8217;s most entertaining. Teams are at their best, slinging the ball far downfield in order to try and gain an advantage before the break. As a viewer, these are the parts of the game I remember the most, and my plan puts the focus on the more interesting&amp;nbsp;parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about my plan is that there is no decline in ad revenue. I would suggest against adding more time to the three periods as the whole goal is to reduce football fatigue. Instead, the ad revenue could be made up during the extra break between periods. This would give more time for analysis and the commercials could fit in here, keeping ad revenue the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my plan, there are several benefits and zero costs present&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Football often goes on too long, and shortening the game would make it more palpable for viewers across the globe. The extra break would result in an increase of the hurry up offense, further increasing the highlight potential of the sport as well. Finally, the extra &amp;#8220;half time&amp;#8221; between periods would make up the ad revenue and increase the studio analysis, lowering the fixed costs of those studios. This holiday season, let&amp;#8217;s remember to give thanks and make football more interesting to&amp;nbsp;watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The often terrible Thursday Night Games have been deemed a likely culprit. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am easily not a scientist, it would not surprise me that having more time to rest between periods would lower the concussion rate of football players, besides the fact that they are playing less.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is a complicated one, because there are benefits due to a relative as well as absolute increase. Receiving a raise is a common example of a relative increase, because one&amp;#8217;s wages are higher than they were before. Another example is when Walmart raised it&amp;#8217;s minimum wage but other companies did not. The wage Walmart paid was relatively higher, because other companies&amp;#8217; wages stayed the&amp;nbsp;same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, an absolute increase is when more money is getting paid out, but the other relationships between wages and products stay the same. The typical macroeconomics example includes wages being doubled but also having prices double. In this new world, if I want to buy something it still costs the same percentage of my wages. However, I do have more money overall than I did&amp;nbsp;before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get back to the question at hand, because a minimum wage increase means that wages are not higher relatively speaking, I see the point being made. The prestige of a higher salary decreases if I can transfer to another company paying the same salary. Put another way, if a company is paying a higher wage than all the other companies, I&amp;#8217;m more likely to stay there. However, if every other company is paying the same wage, there is no loss in salary to keep me committed to the&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, higher wages on an absolute basis do result in higher productivity, especially at a minimum wage level. A &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/nyregion/older-workers-are-increasingly-entering-fast-food-industry.html" title="Older Workers entering fast food industry"&gt;New York Times Article&lt;/a&gt; from a few years ago indicates that older workers are increasingly entering the fast food industry; these are the workers that would most benefit from a minimum wage increase. More costs are incurred as people age, and a higher wage can reduce some of the financial stress present.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Having more of a financial cushion lets workers focus solely on working, increasing their&amp;nbsp;productivity.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this clarifies the benefits that can result from raising wages. Raising the minimum wage level may not increase the relative benefits, but should result in absolute benefits. Whether or not that outweighs the cost of the wages is a discussion for another&amp;nbsp;post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, efficiency wage theory says that wages may not be at a level where the market clears. In other words, there is an equilibrium wage, and then a firm (or several firms) are paying a higher wage than before. This results in productivity benefits. In the original model, these benefits are due to a lack of shirking but more money can increase worker productivity in a number of ways (making sure transportation isn&amp;#8217;t an issue, being able to pay for medicine, better food, etc).&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible examples of a higher wage increasing productivity include letting a worker purchase a more reliable car which makes transportation to and from work easier, letting the worker pay for child care, and being able to afford better medicine, resulting in less sick time being taken. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price Discriminate? Let me&amp;nbsp;explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price&amp;nbsp;Discrimination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than the much worse type of discrimination, &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination"&gt;Price Discrimination&lt;/a&gt; is the idea of selling the same product in different markets at different prices to maximize revenue. Two common examples include giving a student discount and feature reduction in software. A student discount is used to get students to pay for a product they otherwise would not buy. They often don&amp;#8217;t have the money to buy the good at full price&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so by using a student discount, a firm can still charge the same price to the old customers, yet also bring in a new source of&amp;nbsp;revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, another common example is hobbled software that can be sold for a lower price. Pricing software &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/how-to-price-a-digital-good.html"&gt;is complicated&lt;/a&gt;, but the key thing to remember is that the marginal cost is zero &amp;#8212; it doesn&amp;#8217;t cost more to produce an extra copy. However, by artificially removing features and selling it for a lower price, a software maker can appeal to different customer segments to maximize revenue. As an example, the popular statistics program Stata has &lt;a href="https://www.stata.com/products/which-stata-is-right-for-me/"&gt;five different versions&lt;/a&gt; of its product, all aimed at a different market segment. By having a cheaper version for students, Stata can capture the revenue it otherwise would lose if it just had one price&amp;nbsp;point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retina and&amp;nbsp;Price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple here is using this technique to differentiate between customer segments. Those who care about &amp;#8220;pro features&amp;#8221; are willing to pay for them &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the retina screen is an example of such a feature. In his article, Snell says&amp;nbsp;that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder: To what degree are Retina Macs more expensive because the Retina display (and the increased graphics power required to drive them) adds to the cost of making the device, and to what degree is it a feature differentiator that Apple feels it can use as a way to get people to spend more&amp;nbsp;money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a classic example of price discrimination. By keeping the price of computers with a retina screen artificially high, Apple is able to segment the market into those that will pay more for retina, and those that care less about the feature. For those don&amp;#8217;t care about a retina screen, they can buy a Macbook Air and still be happy with such a purchase. Apple still gets their money, and these users that are indifferent regarding a screen aren&amp;#8217;t paying for a feature they don&amp;#8217;t care about. Thus, Apple is able to capture revenue from both customer segments, making management, as well as the consumers&amp;nbsp;happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a discount often has tremendous appeal&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or begrudgingly willing to pay   &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sticking with the ebook example from the initial post, let&amp;#8217;s say that the first book in a series (book 1) is elastic &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, I believe that books get more inelastic the further along in the series you go. If I loved books 1-4, I&amp;#8217;d probably pay a high amount for book 5. This implies that the pricing for a book series could increase based on how far along a reader is in that series. As an example, if I had a book series, I could charge three dollars for the first book, four dollars for the second, all the way up to twelve dollars for the fifth book in the series. &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pricing can also be used and thought of as a marketing tool. Say you have a series of books as above. The first book as already recouped it&amp;#8217;s costs&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the current price is still set at three dollars. However, because the marginal costs are zero, you can now drop the price of the book for a short time (or forever) to capture new readers into the&amp;nbsp;series. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price can also decrease to capture &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer_surplus.asp"&gt;consumer surplus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, using a tool called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination"&gt;price discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, the digital good can be priced relatively high. This means that the sales are mostly made up of hardcore fans who would pay anything for the book. This also has the added benefit of keeping initial reviews of the book high, as your biggest fans can be counted on to have a mostly positive impression about your work. As sales max out at the high price point, the price can then be decreased, in order to move down the demand curve. In short, the people who are slightly more apathetic or are willing to pay less for your novel get the chance to buy the book. As the price decreases, more people will end up purchasing it, maximizing&amp;nbsp;sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also critical is knowing your place in the genre. If all the books in the romance section are seven dollars, and I&amp;#8217;m trying to sell a similar romance novel at fifteen dollars, I am not setting myself for success. Likewise, if you&amp;#8217;re trying to think of something to write, it&amp;#8217;s worth examining the other competitors in the market, to figure out if one genre is more profitable than another&amp;nbsp;genre. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, it&amp;#8217;s important to differentiate your good from others. A question worth asking is what makes your product defensible and different from everyone else&amp;#8217;s. &lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rules work for more traditional products as well. If I&amp;#8217;m selling a set of software productivity tools, I can have an introduction tool priced lower to sucker people into the ecosystem and then have complementary tools priced higher. Same if I&amp;#8217;m selling action figures. When selling anything it is important to scout the competition especially to find a way to differentiate your product. Pricing is a difficult and complicated topic that bears thinking about, and hopefully this article describes some of the most important factors at&amp;nbsp;play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(economics)" title="Elasticity Wikipedia"&gt;Elasticity&lt;/a&gt; is a well known, fundamental economic concept regarding price and the quantity of goods sold. A good is elastic if a change in price matters in determining the number of goods that are sold, relatively. For example, I raise the price of my widget by 5% and the quantity sold drops 20%. Elastic goods are often luxury goods. A good is inelastic if price doesn&amp;#8217;t matter as much. Think gasoline or electricity. Prices could go up by 5%, but you&amp;#8217;d still probably use the same amount of electricity. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, sales for each book in a book series most likely resemble a funnel. I would suspect that the first book in the series sells the most units, while each subsequent book sells fewer and fewer units. However, the fans that keep buying books are the diehard fans, making the sales of the book more inelastic. Thus, you are able to make up the revenue per book by increasing the price of each book in the series.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you&amp;#8217;re thinking of your digital good as a &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/how-to-price-a-digital-good.html"&gt;utility company&lt;/a&gt;, right?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which can be defined as the maximum amount of money the consumers are willing to pay for a good.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, software is &lt;a href="http://avc.com/2014/07/the-dentist-office-software-story/"&gt;a commodity&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I remember my first event wondering what questions to ask. Possible options included &amp;#8220;Do I just ask them for jobs? Ask them about their family?&amp;#8221; as well as other equally as terrible options. Now having attended a couple of events  I feel like I suck a little less at these events, and I&amp;#8217;d like to share some tips that I&amp;#8217;ve found to help me be a better&amp;nbsp;networker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do Research&amp;nbsp;Beforehand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the event even starts, researching about the attendees is key. As soon as you walk through that door, you should already have an action plan on who you want to talk to. After all, why are you even going to this event in the first place? The first step to success is having a plan, because then all you have to do is follow&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduce&amp;nbsp;yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may sound like a no brainer, but introduce yourself! Put yourself in their situation and imagine having someone walk up to you and just stand there. Or stand there and say &amp;#8220;So, how&amp;#8217;s the industry going?&amp;#8221; Thus, by introducing yourself , you can also go a step further and tell them how you fit into their worldview. For example, I&amp;#8217;d say &amp;#8220;Hello! I&amp;#8217;m Zach, a Computer Science and Economics student.&amp;#8221; This allows the person to slot you into their world view and you can now have an excellent conversation. This is important because&amp;nbsp;you&amp;#8230; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have something to&amp;nbsp;say&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part is critical. So you&amp;#8217;ve introduced yourself successfully, and now you have this person staring at you. In addition, you&amp;#8217;ve already done your research, so all you need to do is get them talking. I normally like to ask a question or two of small talk before going into topics such as asking for advice or wondering how they got into the business. Other classic questions include what a typical day looks like, or what they dislike most about the job. These questions are great for getting useful information out of your networkee. For example, if they say that work often requires them to stay late or if they hate meeting with other departments, that says things about the company culture that are useful to&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ask for a business&amp;nbsp;card&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the conversation is finished. You&amp;#8217;ve introduced yourself, said at least one but possible two or more things (good questions about the industry certainly apply), and now you can tell that it&amp;#8217;s time to move on. The second to last thing to do before thanking them is to ask for a business card. As a Millennial, it&amp;#8217;s not a thing that we are accustomed to doing, but every working person should have one with them and it&amp;#8217;s a great conversation ender. This should also let them know that you plan to follow up with them at some point in the near&amp;nbsp;future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ending&amp;nbsp;Strongly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, endings. My least favorite part of a good song, and quite possibly the most awkward thing to do in a conversation. If you&amp;#8217;re at a networking event, people definitely understand that mingling needs to occur. Oftentimes I say something like &amp;#8220;Well, I&amp;#8217;m going to mingle with the crowd some more, but it was nice meeting you!&amp;#8221; And then after the handshake, make a strong move to walk in the opposite direction. That should limit the awkwardness, while leaving a favorable impression near the end that will allow you&amp;nbsp;to&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow-Up&amp;nbsp;afterwards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely crucial. You have the business card, you&amp;#8217;ve waited a day or so, and now it&amp;#8217;s time for you to follow up with the super interesting contact you just made. Here is where having a professional, current LinkedIn really pays off. Since the interaction is fresh in their minds, you can connect with this person. In addition, I often send a follow up email that gets you in their contact list. If there were any steps that you had to complete (for example, submitting your resume), make sure you submit that immediately and you can have your email look like the&amp;nbsp;following:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person&amp;#8217;s Name&lt;/em&gt;
It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday at &lt;em&gt;Networking Event&lt;/em&gt;. Hearing from someone in the industry really helped me clarify my thoughts on &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt;. I &lt;em&gt;did the thing&lt;/em&gt; and would love to talk about next steps whenever you have a&amp;nbsp;moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate your time in talking with me. 
Thanks,
&lt;em&gt;Insert&amp;nbsp;name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal here was to make a short cheat sheet for any networking event. Talking to strangers is difficult and it helps to have a plan to approach such interactions with.  Following such a plan can turn a networking event from a maybe into a sure win that leads to new adventures and&amp;nbsp;opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="networking"></category><category term="guides"></category></entry><entry><title>Do You Really Need a New Macbook Pro?</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/do-you-really-need-a-new-macbook-pro.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-10-31:/do-you-really-need-a-new-macbook-pro.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple&amp;#8217;s forcing people to pick sides in the computing debate and people aren&amp;#8217;t happy about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apple recently released a new Mac computer, and reactions seem mixed. &lt;a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/10/27/new-macbook-pros-and-the-state-of-the-mac/"&gt;On one hand&lt;/a&gt;, the computers don&amp;#8217;t seem to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/792433156909568001" title="Marco Arment Tweet"&gt;appeal&lt;/a&gt; to a pro market. The price is higher than before, and the touch bar seems underwhelming. The usual complaints of maximizing thinness at the expense of battery life and processing power &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/59onxt/preorder_shipping_megathread_mac_lineup_2016/#bottom-comments" title="Reddit preorder shipping thread"&gt;have been seen &lt;/a&gt;as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the computers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pierce/status/791707800879583232"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/"&gt;beautiful&lt;/a&gt;. And demand initially &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pierce/status/791695773486297088"&gt;seems high!&lt;/a&gt; The internals have finally been upgraded, and I am personally excited that they come in the official Space Gray, releasing us from our silver&amp;nbsp;shackles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s going on? Has Apple ceded the pro market to Microsoft? If this computer doesn&amp;#8217;t appeal to professional consumers, who is it actually for? My theory is that Apple realizes that iOS is the future and is charging a legacy tax for everyone who wants to stick with a Mac. This legacy tax will turn consumers sunk costs into increased margins for Apple, while also promoting adoption of their future computing&amp;nbsp;platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of Computing is&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/791724227736985602"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/791724676158398464"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; tweets by Benedict Evans are right on the money. Apple realizes that iOS is the future of computing. Computing only ever gets more abstract &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and iOS is too good at abstracting the many difficult parts of computers away. Steve Jobs &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130109/steve-jobs-was-right-tablets-are-cars-pcs-are-trucks/"&gt;said it best&lt;/a&gt; when he compared PCs to trucks and tablets to cars. PCs will still be around for specialized tasks, but tablets (and even phones) will be good enough for most&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preferences are actually Sunk&amp;nbsp;Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the truth is that tablets are already there. iPads are good enough for 90% of my daily work. Yet people still prefer to have a computer to do &amp;#8220;real work&amp;#8221; on. People get stuck on what&amp;#8217;s been working for them, without exploring what&amp;#8217;s new or what&amp;#8217;s changed. I&amp;#8217;ve used Macs to email and surf the web for the past X years, so I&amp;#8217;m looking for a Mac to email and surf the web, without ever looking at the capabilities of anything else. These biases are present and they are all sunk costs. Apple is exploiting these costs by forcing those who prefer actual computer to now pay for that&amp;nbsp;privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making the pro market pro&amp;nbsp;again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumption rests on the fact that these consumers want the newest hardware. If not, there are plenty of &lt;a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/10/many-macbooks/"&gt;other Macs&lt;/a&gt; that Apple offers. However, those who want the newest hardware yet are unsatisfied with these new offerings are in a tough position. Either they need to fork over the cash to upgrade or switch over to the iPad Pro as a daily computing device. Now Apple can speed adoption of it&amp;#8217;s future platform as some users inevitably realize that an iPad Pro is good enough and switch while also increasing revenue&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for those that depend on a Mac&amp;nbsp;laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract, and also easier to use. For an example, take programming languages. Assembly got abstracted into C, which got abstracted into a bunch of different languages (Python, Ruby, etc). &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s actually an interesting question of elasticity. For those people who care about the cost of the Mac more than the experience of using a Mac (aka using a laptop is elastic), they&amp;#8217;ll either bite the bullet or switch to something else, most likely an iPad Pro. For those who have inelastic computing preferences (which I may have made up) aka those that will buy the computer regardless of any price increase, revenue will increase. Win-win. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The goal of any price is to maximize revenue, and that happens when marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Thus, the price should be where this&amp;nbsp;occurs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For physical goods, this is relatively easy. Marginal cost is simply the cost of producing another unit and firms (should) have enough data on what that number is. Marginal revenue is slightly more complicated; it is the revenue gained from selling one more unit. With physical goods, firms should also have enough data to estimate the demand curve and thus guess at marginal revenue. However, for digital goods the question becomes less&amp;nbsp;simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Primer on&amp;nbsp;Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs for a good can be divided into two parts, variable and fixed. A variable cost is one that increases when the firm produces more goods, such as hiring salespeople or adding more inventory space. Fixed costs are costs that stay the same regardless of how many units you produce, such as buying the factory to produce the goods. No matter how many goods you produce, the cost of the factory will stay the same. The key takeaway here is that fixed costs don&amp;#8217;t increase marginal costs; the factory I had to buy to produce my widgets shouldn&amp;#8217;t enter my calculation when I&amp;#8217;m figuring out how many widgets to produce now. Thus, in order to calculate the marginal costs, simply figure out the variable costs associated with the&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a piece of software then (such as an app or an ebook) the marginal cost is zero. There are no variable costs! In order to &amp;#8220;print&amp;#8221; another ebook, it costs nothing. There are some fixed costs, such as hosting, but as stated above that doesn&amp;#8217;t enter into the marginal cost calculation. So now the question becomes what to charge for software? The firm could pretend that there are some some variable costs, increasing the marginal cost to something from zero. But that doesn&amp;#8217;t make any sense. I think the best way to treat a piece of software is to treat it like a utility&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Utilities as a form of&amp;nbsp;software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unpack the utility company metaphor, imagine an electric company. This electric company has high upfront costs and minimal marginal costs. In the beginning, the company has to string the power lines, install the generators, and generally build out the infrastructure. Setting up this infrastructure puts a company deep into the red. That is why there&amp;#8217;s usually only one power company in an area, because it just doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense to have two companies outlay these massive amount of funds &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But after the infrastructure is put up, the company has the ability to charge whatever it wants, for a good that has basically no marginal cost. It&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;dream! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A piece of software often follows the same path. Initially, the costs run deep as the development process occurs. However, once the software is built, the costs shrink and the revenue can start flooding&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A NaNoWriMo&amp;nbsp;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, we can use writing a ebook. November is &lt;a href="http://nanowrimo.org/"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; which is the national novel writing month. The challenge is then to write an entire book in one month, which works out to writing 2500 words a day. As a bold assumption, say that I am able to crank out those 2500 words in 3 hours. So during the month of November, I have one book sized collection of words for 90 hours of work. However, someone needs to edit the book. Having no idea how long it takes to edit, say that it takes half the time it would take to write the book (so 45 hours). Ignoring all other time costs (marketing, preparing the book for submission to the online stores) the minimum amount is 135 hours worth of work. At a working wage of $20 an hour, before taxes there is an initial outlay of $2700 to become an indie&amp;nbsp;author. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! Once I finish writing the book, my marginal cost is zero. I now can pick a price and sell my book at that price point in order to recoup my initial investment. Because I sank in all the time initially, I can ideally rake the profit that this book brings in forever. If the book sells even remotely well, I&amp;#8217;d consider that a fair&amp;nbsp;trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I&amp;#8217;d consider this a small (super small. Very, very tiny, minusculely small) sample on how to price something. There are other factors to take a look at (elasticity, price point in the market, as a sales technique) but from a purely economic standpoint, this is the technique used to figure out how to price&amp;nbsp;something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of being pure monopolies, such firms are often regulated by the government to prevent people from being priced out of the market (often called a regulated monopoly). However, if a firm is willing to pay to set up the infrastructure and enter the market, does that mean that the price is too high and competition would be good for the consumers? In addition, another question is that if the internet should be such a utility? I&amp;#8217;d argue yes, but these questions are a post for another day.  &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These areas are fragile and the importance of preserving these areas cannot be&amp;nbsp;overstated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an economist, I&amp;#8217;m most interested in Leave No Trace as a question of incentives. Why should I follow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNT&lt;/span&gt; principles in the wilderness when it&amp;#8217;s more work for me? To add salt to the wound, there is a high chance that I will not even get to see the fruits of my labor.

&lt;h2&gt;Theories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the reason why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNT&lt;/span&gt; is so well followed is that it&amp;#8217;s part of a self perpetuating cycle; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNT&lt;/span&gt; is followed because those who go out into the wilderness care about the wilderness. Those are the people most willing to persevere the nature for the future generations and the best way to do this is to follow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNT&lt;/span&gt; principles. It&amp;#8217;s like teaching salesmen a new sales technique. They&amp;#8217;re going to follow the new strategies because it&amp;#8217;s in their best interest to do so. It&amp;#8217;s definitely an interesting thought though, one I plan to follow up&amp;nbsp;on. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="economics"></category><category term="thought experiment"></category><category term="lnt"></category></entry><entry><title>Why Raising the Minimum wage could be a good idea</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/raising-the-minimum-wage-could-be-a-good-idea.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-15T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-10-15:/raising-the-minimum-wage-could-be-a-good-idea.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;2 reasons. No conclusion. All serious&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Raising the minimum wage has recently been a hot button issue for many people. On one hand, we have those against such an increase. Their thinking goes that if the cost of labor increases, firms will shift away from that input (labor) and move towards other inputs (capital, etc). More people will then be unemployed, resulting in a loss of jobs for those who most need it. This theory can be found in any labor economics class and has guided decision making for&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the debate, we have those that are for such an increase. Oftentimes the only justification given is a moral one: it is impossible to support a family with a low minimum wage. However, there are ideas supporting such an increase: the income effect along with efficiency wage theory are two of them. A discussion on which side is correct is beyond the scope of this blog post; however, I will attempt to better illustrate what these benefits are and how they benefit both the worker and the&amp;nbsp;firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Income&amp;nbsp;Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The income effect says that increasing the minimum wage will give the workers more income (shockingly). The workers will then spend that money, increasing the demand for the goods that the workers buy. As a simple example, imagine workers at a widget factory. The wage increases for those workers. The workers then turn around and buy more widgets, because they can now afford to. This new demand for widgets forces the factory to increase output: potentially forcing the factory to hire even more workers! With the increase in output, the factory receives more profit and the workers have a higher wage. Everyone is happier with more money in their pockets, all due to the initial increase in the minimum&amp;nbsp;wage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Efficiency Wage&amp;nbsp;Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second benefit that can result from an increase in the minimum wage is efficiency wage theory. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_wage" title="Efficiency wage theory wiki"&gt;Efficiency wage theory&lt;/a&gt; is the idea that workers become more productive the more they get paid. While seeming counterintuitive at first, the idea makes sense logically; if I&amp;#8217;m getting paid a lot of money, I want to keep that job. This implies that I&amp;#8217;ll work harder at that same job, becoming more productive (and consequently more valuable) as a worker. The value that the company receives from me working harder may outweigh my additional pay. A recent &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/upshot/how-did-walmart-get-cleaner-stores-and-higher-sales-it-paid-its-people-more.html" title="Walmart Efficiency Theory"&gt;New York Times article&lt;/a&gt; shows a example of this idea being put into practice. Walmart increased the pay of their workers which resulted in more valuable employees. The stores were cleaner and customer satisfaction increased; well worth the slight increase in pay for those&amp;nbsp;employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article was not meant to offer a firm conclusion on raising the minimum wage; it was intended to spark a discussion on some of the undiscussed benefits that could result from such an increase. Raising the minimum wage is often defined as a no win situation; however, that is not the case. The income effect and efficiency wage theory demonstrates some of the value companies can possibly receive out of a increase in the cost of&amp;nbsp;labor. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="labor economics"></category><category term="labor"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="thought experiment"></category></entry><entry><title>A Love Letter to 1Password</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/love-letter-to-1password.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-10T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-10-10:/love-letter-to-1password.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s not even Valentine&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Day.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before 1Password, my life was a security nightmare. Darkness ruled: I had the same password and email for every account that I created. This lead to me having multiple accounts that were easily hackable. My online presence was maintained by a&amp;nbsp;thread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then one day light descended down on me: I was introduced to 1Password. The application itself is a game changer. It made unique, secure passwords easy instead of impossible. I wasn&amp;#8217;t forced to memorize some variation of a weak password after making an account and my use of the &amp;#8220;forget password&amp;#8221; link decreased&amp;nbsp;tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, If you have someone in your life who struggles to remember passwords, please give them the gift of this application. It will help their lives tremendously.

1. There is a certain nonzero percentage of people who are not morning people
2. These people are not enjoying the typical 9-5 job. 
3. It stands to reason that if companies want to be competitive in hiring the best talent, companies need ways to distinguish themselves. Shouldn&amp;#8217;t it be the case that there should be more choices offered regarding job hours, as a way to separate themselves from the&amp;nbsp;pack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why hasn&amp;#8217;t this&amp;nbsp;occurred?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be self perpetuating.  Because no high value employees have asked for it, no one asks for it. The other option is that the benefits of having everyone there at roughly the same time outweigh the costs of acquiring talent at a lower&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because let&amp;#8217;s be honest, who wouldn&amp;#8217;t give preference to a position with more flexible&amp;nbsp;hours? &lt;/p&gt;

Of note, he states that the demand of the exploits are the same, so it implies that higher cost of the iOS exploits is due to the limited supply of the iOS&amp;nbsp;exploits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#8217;ll add that there may be a demand effect here as well. &lt;a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/new-report-reveals-that-ios-users-spend-2-5-more-on-in-app-purchases-than-android-users-700983/" title="In App Purchase Link"&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; shows that iOS users spend about 2.5 times more on in app purchases. I think we can extrapolate this out to say that iOS users spend more on apps and in app purchases because they are generally the more affluent customers. Anecdotally, I also see many working professionals with an iOS device, thus presumably increasing the demand of such an&amp;nbsp;exploit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, while I agree with Person about the differences in supply affecting the price, I also think that there is a demand effect present as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apple"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="analysis"></category><category term="current"></category></entry><entry><title>An Analysis of the Phillips Curve</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/phillips-curve-analysis.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-25T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-09-25:/phillips-curve-analysis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Phillips Curve: Fact or&amp;nbsp;Fiction?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the macroeconomic theories that continues to persist is the idea of the Phillips Curve. &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve" title="Phillips Curve Wiki"&gt;The Phillips Curve&lt;/a&gt; is the idea that unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated. This means that the higher the unemployment rate, the lower the inflation rate. This idea comes from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A. W. H.&lt;/span&gt; Phillips’s study of wage inflation and unemployment in the United Kingdom from 1861 to 1957. The effect was then observed in the 1960&amp;#8217;s in the United States, where it then influenced policies and continues to hold on to this&amp;nbsp;day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, once the United States moved into the 1970&amp;#8217;s and beyond, the Phillips Curve turned out to be untrue. Indeed, there seems to be no correlation between unemployment and inflation. In order to demonstrate this, below is a graph that shows the annual inflation rate and unemployment values from January 1986 to August&amp;nbsp;2016.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Phillips Curve Graph" src="http://zachnielsen.org/images/Phillips Curve Graph.PNG" title="Phillips Curve, 1986-2016"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the graph, one can see that the scatter plot is extremely&amp;#8230;. scattered. If unemployment and inflation were inversely correlated, the points would line up similar to a capital letter L: a high unemployment rate would result in a low inflation rate and a high inflation rate would result in a low unemployment rate. Thus, the idea of the Phillips Curve does not hold&amp;nbsp;up. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="phillips curve"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="analysis"></category><category term="macroeconomics"></category></entry><entry><title>O(n) for data scientists</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/o-for-data-scientists.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-20T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-09-20:/o-for-data-scientists.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Coding just got less&amp;nbsp;complex.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Something that gets studied a lot in computer science is the idea of big O Notation. This basically signifies the complexity of the code that the computer is running. For example, if you give the computer some random data (call it  n random data), how many operations does the computer have to do to the data. This is measured as a function of&amp;nbsp;n.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if one wanted to sort data, the fastest sort that can be completed has a big O notation of O(nlog(n)). This says that the maximum number of times it touches the data is nlog(n), for any n amount of data. Therefore, a lot of time is spent trying to reduce the complexity for any algorithm, aka how many operations the computer has to do to each bit of code. The problem we&amp;#8217;re trying to solve is how can we make an algorithm go faster and implement fewer computations on the&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big O for data&amp;nbsp;scientists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is something that data scientists can use in their own field, especially when writing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; code. A lot of the code I run into is poorly written, and can be reordered in order to speed up the entire&amp;nbsp;process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, say I have 1 million entries that have to be standardized as well as rolled up, so that there are only 2000 groups. Now, one may think that standardizing and then rolling the data up is the best way to do that. That would lead to 1 million entries being standardized, and then that standardized data being rolled&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if the process was reversed, as in the roll up occurs first and then the data standardized, that 1 million standardization operations that have to be performed gets brought down to 2000 (give or take). The query runs a lot faster, and you are able to be more productive while doing&amp;nbsp;so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the rollup has to be performed regardless. However, by standardizing the data after the rollup instead of before, fewer total entries need to be standardized, thus speeding up the entire&amp;nbsp;procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thing to remember is to think through the entire query, and then try to minimize the operations you do to the data. Can the rollup come first? Does the order matter? How can you reduce the stress on the machine? The difference between a good programmer and a great programmer is being able to write a faster procedure that solves the same&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="data"></category><category term="complexity"></category><category term="sql"></category><category term="coding"></category></entry><entry><title>Rolling Data Up</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/rolling-data-up.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-15T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-09-15:/rolling-data-up.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re not talking about a fruit rollup&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A common problem I run into while writing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; code is the idea of rolling up data to a higher level. This just means taking a set of data, and making it less granular in some way. This is commonly done to speed up calculations, at the expense of the ability to drill down into that data. A common example is taking day level data and turning it into month level data. Here, obviously you lose the ability to drill down to sales per day (for example), but it can potentially speed up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; procedures&amp;nbsp;tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I do that currently in Microsoft &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; is by using the dateadd(datediff()) method, along with a group by. Say you have a table with Sales, Product, and day level date, and you want to turn that into month level data. So, you&amp;#8217;d do something that looks like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT Sales = SUM(Sales), Product, DATEADD(DATEDIFF(DateField)) FROM #ExampleTable. GROUP BY PRODUCT, DATEADD(DATEDIFF(DateField)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will take your data, sum the sales per product per month, and group it by product and month. Definitely useful, although I will be waiting for the day until this is built&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="data"></category><category term="sql"></category><category term="coding"></category></entry><entry><title>Clearing the console and environment in R</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/clearing-the-console-and-environment-in-r.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-09-13:/clearing-the-console-and-environment-in-r.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;New Year New R Studio&amp;nbsp;environment&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Clearing the&amp;nbsp;console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things that I find myself wondering while working with R is how to clear the console, and how to clear the environment. The console is the terminal-like area where you can see the command (or commands) that are executing. For me, it oftentimes is easier to clear the console so I can better see any new error messages that occur. Also, another benefit is simply reducing the lines and lines of old, already executed code. In order to do so, you simply press &lt;code&gt;CTRL + L&lt;/code&gt; on a Windows machine, and that will take clear the console for&amp;nbsp;you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clearing the&amp;nbsp;environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R Studio also saves the exact environment that you&amp;#8217;re working with when you exit out of the program, such as the values of certain variables. However, sometimes I want to clear the entire environment, giving myself a fresh environment to start out with. To do that, all I have to do is type &lt;code&gt;rm(list=ls())&lt;/code&gt; into the console. This is a good command to run right before putting any code into&amp;nbsp;production.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="tech tips"></category><category term="r"></category></entry><entry><title>Removing Scientific Notation from R</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/remove-scientific-notation-from-r.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-09-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-09-03:/remove-scientific-notation-from-r.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scientific Notation in R getting ya down?

This will show you&amp;nbsp;how.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;#8217;d like to explain how to get started with trading stocks. I&amp;#8217;ve always been interested in trading stocks, but getting started seemed like such an insurmountable hurdle. In addition, I would like to detail my theories about stock trading, and how I am using those theories to make&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting&amp;nbsp;Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started was actually easier than I thought it would be. The most difficult part was comparing the different stock trading options available and trying to pick the option that would cost me the least amount of money. The service that I landed on was &lt;a href="https://www.robinhood.com" title="Robinhood"&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;, for the simple reason that it lacks the $10 cost per trading transaction that many other services do. A trade without a $10 commission allows me more flexibility in trading, because I don&amp;#8217;t have to make up that $10 in profit. After linking my account&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to Robinhood and transferring some money over, I was ready to make my first trade. But first, I had to figure out my philosophy for&amp;nbsp;investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This initial three month period was a passive attempt at understanding how the market feels to a stock trader. While keeping track of my results, I made no hasty decisions and promptly reaped the fruits of my labor, earning a 15% return in three months. My investing philosophy, while continuing to change and grow currently has four parts:
1. Only invest in areas you know
2. Invest in solid areas that have value, and a high barrier to entry
3. Don&amp;#8217;t make rash judgements. Have a price where you enter, a price where you sell and are happy, as well as a price where you sell if things go south. 
4. Diversify. Don&amp;#8217;t have all of my eggs in one basket, but also be prepared to ride a positive wave, if need&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this theory, I am currently invested in three stocks: Under Armor (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UA&lt;/span&gt;), Twitter (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWTR&lt;/span&gt;) and Advanced Micro Devices (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt;). So far, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt; has been the big winner for me, but I am currently in the green on all three stocks. My thinking for each stock purchase is as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UA&lt;/span&gt;: I wanted a retail company in my portfolio. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UA&lt;/span&gt; has contracts with some of the biggest, youngest names in sports such as Steph Curry and Bryce Harper. In addition, with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NBA&lt;/span&gt; Finals coming up I thought that Under Armor would receive a huge boost to their sales if Golden State won (spoiler: they didn&amp;#8217;t). Overall, I am currently not too thrilled with their performance so far, but I&amp;#8217;m still in a holding&amp;nbsp;pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWTR&lt;/span&gt;: I&amp;#8217;m very much a tech guy, and I think Twitter is highly underrated. Multiple different subcultures have their primary interaction on Twitter (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NBA&lt;/span&gt;, media, etc) and until that goes away, Twitter is still an incredibly valuable company. In addition, Twitter stays on the cutting edge of breaking news stories, and individuals&amp;#8217; Twitter handles are still displayed across television. All that the company requires is the correct vision, but failing that I think an acquisition to the company is increasingly&amp;nbsp;likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt;: As a student of technological forces, I believe that everything will be connected. What was once dumb will become smart. Secondly, I think that Virtual and Augmented reality are only had going to become more and more common in society. Investing in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt; allows me to take the position of selling supplies to the gold miners, and thus is a good investment for the&amp;nbsp;future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, I now have the tools to trade stocks, and a working theory about how to approach my trades. From here, I&amp;#8217;ll work on maximizing my trade value as well as avoiding costly mistakes. In the next installment, I&amp;#8217;ll focus more on the selling aspect, as well as check up on my&amp;nbsp;progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other step that I did was to make a completely separate bank account, in order to more easily track my gains and losses. However, it is completely feasible to trade with one&amp;#8217;s main bank account information. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
