Summary: The most important thing is to start

Inspired by [Erik Person](https://thaterikperson.com/10-year-challenge)[^1], I decided to start my own 10 year challenge. My mission is more challenging because I'm not sure what I want success to look like. However, I will now start creating and writing, and seeing where that leads me. 

Will I be great at it? Probably not, at first. But 10 years will give me enough time to be better at it. I'll check in with myself biannually, to see what and how I'm doing. And then in 10 Years, I'll take a measure of myself and see if I've found "Success", whatever that may look like.
