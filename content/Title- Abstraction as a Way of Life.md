# Computers get more abstract over time
I'd like to make the argument that abstraction and simplification are pervasive aspects of our society. In other words, things get easier over time. While there are some examples of how this doesn't hold up (makeup looks as incomprehensible to me as it would in the Victorian era) there are many more examples of this theory holding true. 
## From fistacuffs to Death Tubes to gustar 
For my first example, I'd like to bring up fighting and general warefare. Fighting went from something that took years to master [^1] to using a bow and arrow [^2] to rifles and now drone strikes. Someone in a chair halfway across the world can cause the same amount of damage as a medieval horde. In a similar case, modern basic training for infantry in the US Army is 10 weeks, and yet these soldiers today are more efficient and well equipped than those in the past. 

A similar case can be made with languages. As background, Spanish has three possible endings for verbs: -ar, -er, and -ir. The way the verbs get conjugated depend on the ending of the verb -- we play has an ending of -amos, but we live ends in -imos. This is because the infinitive verbs respectively end in -ar and -ir. [^3] 

Now contrast this with latin. Latin has [five possible endings](http://bencrowder.net/design/latin/conjugation-charts/ "Conjugation chart") and is significantly tougher to memorize than Spanish. French and Italian, more modern languages descended from Latin also have three endings. Additionally, the pervasiveness of English culture has led to a explosion of English [loan words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword) simplifying language even further. Twitter and tweeting are universal. [^4]
## Sorry, this is not the computing language you're looking for: Please look for more abstraction
Computers too have been following this same path. Initially, computers started out as logic gates: from there, they advanced to adding machines with [punch cards](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era) for data input. After that, programming languages developed: Assembly, C, and then many others [^5]. Interacting with these computing devices also became easier. From the command line came the GUI [^6], which opened up computing to the masses. A visual metaphor made computing easier and more accessible to everyone. I could now double click on a folder and see the file pop up, instead of having to explain the terminal command [^7].
## A cell phone in every pocket
But the computer abstraction story isn't done yet. Smartphones and tablets do away with much of the other friction that comes with using a computer. Who needs a file system when the data you need is right there, whenever you need it? No need to update the virus protection, navigate a folder hierarchy, or update drivers: phones and tablets are simply easier to use [^8]. Smartphones are the first and only computers for a majority of the world's population, due (in part) to the fact that friction is abstracted away. [^9]
## So what's the point? 
The key takeaway is understanding that technological abstraction removes friction. Future innovations show this as well: VR and AR will make interacting with menus a thing of the past. AI assistants and self driving cars are both examples of a difficult thing becoming easier. In order to predict the future, look at the points of friction and imagine those disappearing. That will probably be the direction that the future heads.

[^1]:	Sword fighting and hand to hand combat being obvious examples here.

[^2]:	Which can be taught in months, if not quicker

[^3]:	Infinitive verbs can be thought of a verbs in a base state: to play, to run. 

[^4]:	Indeed, I was taught that the Spanish verb for to tweet is tweetar. 

[^5]:	C is the programming language that other programming languages are written in. Also, C is the forefather in a lot of ways. C++  was built to improve upon C's faults. Python abstracts all of the messiness away; "dangerous" behavior (such as pointers) just goes away. Whole errors of bugs just disappear.

[^6]:	aka the desktop

[^7]:	Not coincidentally, there was then [a computer in every home](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3357701/Bill-Gatess-dream-A-computer-in-every-home.html)

[^8]:	Chromebook's recent increase in popularity speaks to this as well. Schools don't have to worry about maintenance. The extra benefits in cost and ease of use add more reasons why this is a viable purchase.

[^9]:	I'd argue that a persistent 4G connection helps too. A dell with an ethernet connection is unsustainable in Algeria. More useful work can be done with an Android phone and a data connection.
