Presented by Al Sweigart, this video is a no nonsense look on how to get started with some basic&amp;nbsp;automation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Selenium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium is used in testing web apps; however, it can also be used to automate any online activity. His selenium example looks like the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;from selenium import webdriver&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;browser = webdriver.Firefox()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;brower.get('theurl.com’)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;element = browser.find_element_by_css_selector(the css selector)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;element.text&lt;/code&gt; 
&lt;code&gt;element.click()&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;browser.quit()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This example opens a web browser and navigates to a web page. From there, it finds a specific element, grabs the text and then clicks on that element. Selenium is useful because it can handle the minutiae that comes with navigating the&amp;nbsp;web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from the top, a simple &lt;code&gt;import selenium&lt;/code&gt; does not work, the key is to import the web driver from selenium. Lines 2 and 3 start a browser on screen and navigates to the inputted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line 4 is where the magic happens. Instead of trying to follow the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; chain, I can inspect an element on screen &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and then copy the selector path directly from the developer&amp;nbsp;tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other useful methods can be used to send keys, submit, and refresh a web&amp;nbsp;page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyAutoGUI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyAutoGUI is a package that is more useful with automating tasks on screen.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This module can be installed by using pip which looks like the following:  &lt;code&gt;pip install pyautogui&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be useful, PyAutoGUI needs the pixel coordinates of where to click. To solve this problem, there is a useful function called &lt;code&gt;displayMousePosition()&lt;/code&gt;. By running this function, the program will give a real time position for where the mouse is on the screen. This is a great way to plan out where the mouse needs to be in order to click the desired&amp;nbsp;targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there’s several other useful functions: &lt;code&gt;click(), typewrite(), hotkey('ctrl','o')&lt;/code&gt; are three of the most useful. Typewrite() is used to send text to the active program.  &lt;code&gt;moveTo()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;moveRel()&lt;/code&gt; will move the cursor to a specific point or in relation to where it is currently. Finally, there’s a &lt;code&gt;locateOnScreen()&lt;/code&gt; method to match a screenshot with something on&amp;nbsp;screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html"&gt;documentation &lt;/a&gt; online is well written and contains all of the methods that can be implemented with&amp;nbsp;PyAutoGUI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation is clearly the area where I am slacking the most. These tools have great potential to simplify the daily computing process and I look forward to trying&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right click, inspect element&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which can be gathered by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; part of the name.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Maybe you saw my post on the &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/the-tools-of-a-business-analyst.html#the-tools-of-a-business-analyst"&gt;tools you can use for analysis&lt;/a&gt; but regardless; if you&amp;#8217;re interested in the field yet unclear what that entails, this should help clarify the demands of data&amp;nbsp;science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why&amp;nbsp;Now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, because computers have gotten so much more powerful, we can now collect and process a ton of data.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Unrelated, statistics has a ton of interesting techniques to answer questions like &amp;#8220;does this affect that?&amp;#8221; Or &amp;#8220;can we predict this using these three measures?&amp;#8221; There have been several breakthroughs recently that have increased the accuracy of these&amp;nbsp;techniques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solving interesting&amp;nbsp;problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, a bright soul put these two ideas together. Merging these more powerful computers along with new and improved statistical techniques have led to businesses being able to use these resources in a practical manner. Data scientists can improve the bottom line of any business in a variety of&amp;nbsp;ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, say that I am in charge of a grocery store. I have data showing the products that were purchased together and the price that they were purchased at. I can use data science to say &amp;#8220;what happens to the sales of Product B if I lower the  price of Product A?&amp;#8221; Pricing changes are critically important, yet were often based on gut instinct. Now we can test these conclusions and see if they&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;valid.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prediction and&amp;nbsp;variance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, data science is using statistics and computers for prediction and analysis. Part statistician, part computer science, and part business analyst, data science is an exciting field to be entering in today&amp;#8217;s day and&amp;nbsp;age. &lt;/p&gt;

The main takeaway from this episode is Gray saying that by tracking all of your time, you can better understand where it’s all going. Humans are great at fooling themselves, and having accurate measurements about how long tasks take helps when planning out your&amp;nbsp;week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, Gray told a story, where he would tell his wife that he would be on his way home right after he completed a routine task. However, this task would take Gray the rest of the afternoon, which his wife knew! After tracking his time, he now could recognize that his assessment of how long this task would take was wildly inaccurate, and he now could give a better measure of when he would be finished with this&amp;nbsp;task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another focus of this episode is hiring. Both Myke and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGP&lt;/span&gt; Gray are in the process of hiring an employee. By measuring the time specific tasks are taking, Myke and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGP&lt;/span&gt; Gray know how many hours they can pass off to their newly hired employee. I thought it was a very smart way to go about the hiring process. Time tracking will allow you have an accurate measure of the time you can be saving, and is the perfect way to find out if hiring an employee is worth it or&amp;nbsp;not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practical&amp;nbsp;Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, I’ll talk about how I got into time tracking, along with some advantages that I’ve seen from starting to track my time. Because I’m just starting, I didn’t want to get crazy with web automation (using a tool like Toggl and Workflow). I found an app for my iPhone called ATracker &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRO&lt;/span&gt;. This app is exactly what I’m looking for: I can hit a button and start a new&amp;nbsp;timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I set up various timers where I think I spend most of my time.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I tried to go big picture and then give myself room for improvement. By starting immediately, I can find out where my initial plan falls short, and then I can create another timer to cover any activities that I had&amp;nbsp;missed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Productive and Unproductive&amp;nbsp;Split&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tip that I have is to set aside two timers for relaxing: productively and unproductively. A typical situation that I find myself in is that I’ll be writing a blog post, and then I’ll flip to Clash Royale and play a quick match. To me, that is unproductive relaxing; however, if I am watching a movie while eating dinner, that is productive&amp;nbsp;relaxing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I have an unproductive reading timer and a productive reading timer. The unproductive reading consists of science fiction and fantasy. The productive reading could be nonfiction books, news articles, or other readings that&amp;nbsp;educate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sleep&amp;nbsp;Woes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One category that I may remove is the idea of tracking how much sleep I track. The idea of tracking sleep has always been interesting for me; however, I don’t know if this app is the best place to do it. I could see myself breaking that out into a separate app, along with better information on how well I slept that night. Currently my sleep time is (deservedly) overwhelming everything else. For ease of comparison, I may&amp;nbsp;stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clear&amp;nbsp;Benefit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One benefit that I am already seeing is that by being honest with myself about tracking time, I already want to limit how much time I’m spending on my goofing off category. It’s so funny how by measuring something, we improve it. By just being aware that all of my time is being tracked, I want to spend it in a ultimately better&amp;nbsp;way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Concluding&amp;nbsp;remarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think that time tracking has plenty of uses for all types of people. From office workers to students, everyone can benefit from a more mindful approach on how they are spending their time. I think that the statistics are going to be interesting to see, and I’ll be sure to note any fun visualizations that result from seeing how I spend my time. Overall, the main thing to remember is to not beat yourself up for any mistakes. As an example, I’m still not sure where I should put twitter! No matter what, any improvement is better than no&amp;nbsp;improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

They should instead focus on the right way to&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s post is on the technical part of being a business analyst. In my experiences, I have found that being a business analyst requires you to be able to do three&amp;nbsp;things: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;import/manage the&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;manipulate the&amp;nbsp;data &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;visualize the&amp;nbsp;data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools you use to do that depend on both the company and what you are familiar with. For example, if the company is using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; to store their data, it definitely makes sense to learn &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, there is a ton of inherent flexibility with choosing your tools. The most important thing is to be able to accomplish those three tasks that I listed above. Below I&amp;#8217;ll list some examples of how these tools can fit together, if you’re unsure of what to learn&amp;nbsp;first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say you&amp;#8217;re just on your own and want to create a simple heat map with the data already in excel. You&amp;#8217;re pretty savvy with coding in Visual Basic, so all you have to do is google heat map excel and you&amp;#8217;re off to the races. Checking off the three categories, you can manage, manipulate, and visualize the data all in excel. Easy&amp;nbsp;peazy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now let’s expand the above example: maybe you have to get and transform hundreds of observations from 36 different excel sheets. Doable yes, but difficult. Here, it makes sense to use a different, more capable tool. After reading reviews, you decide to download python and use pandas to manage your data (with the terrific read_csv function). The same three categories are covered, but in different ways. Importing the data is accomplished with read_csv, pandas is terrific with manipulating the data, and python has several libraries that let one visualize the&amp;nbsp;data. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we can look at a bigger organization. Say that you are working at a company with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; backend that prefers their graphs in Tableau. I’m sure there’s a python package that lets you Connect to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; Database and then import the data into pandas similar to the second example. However, the data may be changed daily. Instead of having to run the same python script every night, the most practical method here may be to build a new table in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; and then connect to that table directly in Tableau. Here the steps are somewhat out of order; you manipulate the data in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;, and then import it and visualize it in&amp;nbsp;Tableau. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point here is that there are several different tools available for becoming a business analyst, each having their own positives and negatives. What matters more here is the ability to pick the tool that applies best in the situation. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; and tableau is a great one-two punch, but if you need to do serious statistical transformations it is best to learn&amp;nbsp;Python. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to give a recommendation on what people should learn, I would suggest Tableau. Practice finding data in excel spreadsheets and then importing them into Tableau. Once you run into the limitations of Tableau &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I would recommend moving onto Python; it’s the tool that easiest to manage as one person.&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, if you are committed to entering the business world, learning &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; may be&amp;nbsp;critical.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the idea of learning all these different tools is slightly terrifying, do not worry. The positive note is that these skills are similar and easily transferable. Dealing with a dataframe in Python with Pandas is similar to manipulating a data set in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;. Graphing follows from this trend; the skills are similar regardless of what tool that you use. It is more important to learn the meta-skills of dealing with data analysis: what’s the best way to graph this, what am I looking to achieve here. The tools are the easy part, it’s the thinking that’s&amp;nbsp;important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if cost is an issue&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the free cost isn’t terrible either. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Benefits of&amp;nbsp;Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a way to make your computer smarter. The automation movement is growing, and with apps like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IFTTT&lt;/span&gt;, Zapier, and Workflow, now is a great time to get into the automation&amp;nbsp;movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to get&amp;nbsp;started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, you’ve gotten a slight introduction to automation either through a Macstories post, Workflow being featured on the App Store, or by finally checking out what all of the hype is about. And so you sign up for one of the apps mentioned above. After opening up the homepage/app you immediately get bombarded by tons of different options. “Should I use this app, or maybe I should use this other version? This is popular recipe but doesn’t apply, maybe this automation thing isn’t for me?” I think that this is a big problem with the current automation environment, and I plan on spending the rest of the article discussing how to use automation effectively. I’ll talk about the best way to get started with automation and give some advice on the best way to approach the idea of automation. To keep it consistent, I’ll also be using Zapier for this introduction&amp;nbsp;post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First, do a workflow&amp;nbsp;analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to becoming a successful automation expert is to examine your workflow. What are the tasks that need to get done and where is there dead weight? As an example, imagine that you were a small business owner; you probably have a website with a recommendations and suggestions section as well as email signup link. In addition, you like to send out an email after someone makes a purchase and you also have an overall sales funnel for business to business sales. As far as hobbies go, you’re kind of a running nut. Tracking your runs is something you’d like to start and have been looking to do so for&amp;nbsp;awhile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step would be to examine what apps you currently use and if it’s now time to switch to a more wildly supported application.  To continue the above example, the recommendations/suggestions section could be hardcoded into your website. This could be changed to a specialized form, which means you don’t have to get your hands dirty adjusting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; on your page whenever you need to change the options&amp;nbsp;available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A far as email signups go, you heard about Mailchimp on a podcast forever ago and have been using it ever since, so you’re ahead of the technology curve there. However, in order to add a customer to the recently purchased list, you copy and paste the email from your sales software.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your business to business sales aren’t a huge part of your business (yet), so you’re currently okay tracking this part of your business with a couple excel spreadsheets. Finally, you recently got introduced to this running app Runkeeper on your iPhone and love it. However, you want to add your runs to a spreadsheet for further data&amp;nbsp;manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pain Point&amp;nbsp;Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve gone through some of your business workflows, we can see areas where we can use automation to simplify the process. 
- By changing to a specialized website form builder, we can leave the option open for that to be automated.
- Mailchimp has a Zapier integration, so there is definitely automation potential there. For example, if we can remove the manual cutting and pasting that would be a life saver. 
- If we could find a way to automate Runkeeper to backup all of your runs, that would be&amp;nbsp;magical &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implement One&amp;nbsp;Change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve examined some pain points, my advice would be to make one change. By making one change at a time, this will allow you to get your feet wet. Maybe you are unfamiliar with the syntax of Zapier or what to see how seamless this process really&amp;nbsp;is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first change I would make would be to add your runs to a Google sheet. Both Runkeeper and Google sheets are supported by Zapier, and this has minimal impact on your business if you’re unsure of this “automation”&amp;nbsp;trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a plan, you can open up Zapier and begin the creation process. The process is as easy as searching for Runkeeper and then Google sheets. After select the triggers you want, your recipe should be good to go! As easy as that, you’ve automated something. Give it a test run &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and see how it works&amp;nbsp;out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rinse, Wash, and Repeat as&amp;nbsp;necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’re a seasoned automation veteran, you can start automating your other pain points. From here, I would branch to Mailchimp and then the web form and sales funnel. Then it’s just being aware of any pain points that pop up as your business&amp;nbsp;expands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The True Benefits of&amp;nbsp;Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation to me isn’t so much about the time savings.&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It’s mainly about reducing &lt;strong&gt;mental overload&lt;/strong&gt;. That to me is the power of computers. By automating the busy work in my life, I really can focus on doing the work that matters and I avoid wasting time on the stuff that does&amp;nbsp;not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like an animal! &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pun absolutely intended&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which can be substantial&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Wouldn&amp;#8217;t you be ecstatic? Luckily, there is. It&amp;#8217;s a type of technology that is built into every website, and it&amp;#8217;s called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a little more complicated to set up than Facebook, but it&amp;#8217;s worth it in the long run to have a curated reading list with you, wherever you&amp;nbsp;go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, it&amp;#8217;s pretty easy. All you need is to decide if you want an app that syncs,&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and then pick an app accordingly and you&amp;#8217;re off to the&amp;nbsp;races!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; readers and syncing services out there, so here are the three of the most&amp;nbsp;common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://feedly.com/i/welcome" title="Feedly Home Page"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.inoreader.com/?lang=en_US"&gt;Inoreader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newsblur.com"&gt;Newsblur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three apps are have their own sync service, which is key for me. While researching this article, I found this post by &lt;a href="https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/"&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; very helpful as&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the app downloaded and an account set up, you can begin adding websites. I recommend adding websites that don&amp;#8217;t post too frequently, because it&amp;#8217;s easy to burnout on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;. When I first started using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;, I added several websites that published 10&amp;#8217;s of articles a day. Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve trimmed my feed down so that my unread articles rarely peak 25.  For a deeper dive into the topic, Marco Arment wrote &lt;a href="https://marco.org/2013/03/26/power-of-rss"&gt;a great post&lt;/a&gt; on how to use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; awhile ago and it still holds&amp;nbsp;true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m always wary when people say that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; is dead, or does not have a place in today&amp;#8217;s society. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; is a standard that will be around forever, and the community is thriving. To serve an unfulfilled niche is something to be proud of; I hope to spread awareness of this product and keep this community&amp;nbsp;thriving.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be useful if you have the same application on an iPhone and iPad and want to have the status of both be the same at all times. For example, if the article is read on the iPhone, it&amp;#8217;ll disappear on the iPad. This should also mean that you can read articles on the web, as well. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Getting and playing with data is one of the tenets of being a data scientist/economist. However, it is difficult to know how to proceed an open, entirely new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;. Below is a checklist for me (and all of, truly) to follow in order to maintain scientific&amp;nbsp;integrity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a hypothesis to test
    Whenever I have a new dataset, my immediate desire is to start running regressions on any combination of variables. However, I now realize that is the wrong way to begin. I should first have a hypothesis that I want to test, and then find data that can help me find a solution. The scientific method that everyone learned in middle school is actually useful, who would have&amp;nbsp;thought?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for any outliers
    Now that you have a hypothesis and data that can be used to determine if the hypothesis is true, the next step would be to examine the data and make sure it is relatively sound. Normally this can be accomplished by noting any outliers, and seeing if they can be removed or not. &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In addition, I like to check the spread of the data, establishing a baseline for each variable in my head. Does the mean of variable x seem higher than normal? That is worth examining in closer&amp;nbsp;detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the regression
    After noting the hypothesis and eliminating any possible outliers, it is now time to run the actual regression. If the results are statistically significant, then the mission is complete On the other hand, if the results are less than spectacular then it is time to change your hypothesis. What could be better? Is there any information that can be added/removed that would lead to a working conclusion? After a new hypothesis is made, the cycle can start&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated before, whenever I receive new data, I have a tendency to run regressions without a thought as to what the results mean or the quality of the results. Following this list will allow me to approach the problem in a more scientific way, leading to better analysis and more interesting&amp;nbsp;results.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a statistics class one time, and the professor asks us if we knew when it was acceptable to remove outliers. After staring in silence for a bit, the professor remarked that it is when another piece of data contradicts the outlier&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, getting the age of all the students in the classroom, the mean would be around 21. However, say there was an outlier of 67. Delving deeper into that entry, we find out that is actually the teacher&amp;#8217;s age. Then it would be permissible to remove that entry. However, that entry could also be legal, if that was a returning student. This explanation continues to be the best way to determine outliers.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

In the United States (and I&amp;#8217;m told in most of the world), there is the idea of the&lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_resolution" title="Wikipedia"&gt;New Year&amp;#8217;s Resolution&lt;/a&gt; which is setting a goal at the start of the new year in order to improve as an individual during the next 365&amp;nbsp;days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are three ideas that I&amp;#8217;ve gathered from my readings on what makes a good goal. I write them as a reminder to myself, understanding that practical goal setting is half of the&amp;nbsp;battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure the goal is measurable. 
    Goals, like life, need to have a way to determine if success has been met. Want to exercise more is not a good New Years Resolution; however, wanting to run three times a week is. In the second example, there is an easy way to determine if success has been met unlike the first goal which is nebulous in&amp;nbsp;nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, perhaps one&amp;#8217;s desire is to lose weight. Stupendous! However, what does that mean? Do you want to lose one pound? 10 pounds? Over the year/next three months? These are all valid options, and it&amp;#8217;s up to you to measure what success in this case looks&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track the results.
    Now that you have a definable goal, it is important to track your progress in achieving that goal. There are many possible methods for doing so, including paper and pen, an iPhone app, or a giant wall calendar. Being able to determine success is a crucial component of goal&amp;nbsp;setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if my goal was to lose weight, but did not know my weight before starting the resolution. Maybe I cut soda out of my diet, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure if any change occurred. Instead of setting oneself up for failure, having a start point and end point change the game&amp;nbsp;dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t try to do too much. 
    Finally, the last piece of advice I&amp;#8217;ve gathered is to not try and do too much with your goal setting. For example, while declaring New Years resolutions I may be trying to eat healthier, starting to work out as well as wanting to start a blog. These three goals are all large endeavors. It is more useful to focus on one at a time to create the habit before moving on to the next&amp;nbsp;resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the three tools that I&amp;#8217;ve found help make goal setting successful. By clarifying the goal, tracking the result and not doing too much, this makes the goal both more practical and achievable. Using these techniques, it is far more likely that these goals will stick, making 2017 a year for the record&amp;nbsp;books. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="New Years Resolutions"></category><category term="NYE"></category><category term="goals"></category><category term="guides"></category></entry><entry><title>How to Not Suck at Networking</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/how-to-not-suck-at-networking.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-11-05T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-11-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-11-05:/how-to-not-suck-at-networking.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Avoiding awkward conversations in six easy&amp;nbsp;steps!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s often tough to go to networking events and feel like you&amp;#8217;re on equal footing with industry professionals. I remember my first event wondering what questions to ask. Possible options included &amp;#8220;Do I just ask them for jobs? Ask them about their family?&amp;#8221; as well as other equally as terrible options. Now having attended a couple of events  I feel like I suck a little less at these events, and I&amp;#8217;d like to share some tips that I&amp;#8217;ve found to help me be a better&amp;nbsp;networker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do Research&amp;nbsp;Beforehand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the event even starts, researching about the attendees is key. As soon as you walk through that door, you should already have an action plan on who you want to talk to. After all, why are you even going to this event in the first place? The first step to success is having a plan, because then all you have to do is follow&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduce&amp;nbsp;yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may sound like a no brainer, but introduce yourself! Put yourself in their situation and imagine having someone walk up to you and just stand there. Or stand there and say &amp;#8220;So, how&amp;#8217;s the industry going?&amp;#8221; Thus, by introducing yourself , you can also go a step further and tell them how you fit into their worldview. For example, I&amp;#8217;d say &amp;#8220;Hello! I&amp;#8217;m Zach, a Computer Science and Economics student.&amp;#8221; This allows the person to slot you into their world view and you can now have an excellent conversation. This is important because&amp;nbsp;you&amp;#8230; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have something to&amp;nbsp;say&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part is critical. So you&amp;#8217;ve introduced yourself successfully, and now you have this person staring at you. In addition, you&amp;#8217;ve already done your research, so all you need to do is get them talking. I normally like to ask a question or two of small talk before going into topics such as asking for advice or wondering how they got into the business. Other classic questions include what a typical day looks like, or what they dislike most about the job. These questions are great for getting useful information out of your networkee. For example, if they say that work often requires them to stay late or if they hate meeting with other departments, that says things about the company culture that are useful to&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ask for a business&amp;nbsp;card&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the conversation is finished. You&amp;#8217;ve introduced yourself, said at least one but possible two or more things (good questions about the industry certainly apply), and now you can tell that it&amp;#8217;s time to move on. The second to last thing to do before thanking them is to ask for a business card. As a Millennial, it&amp;#8217;s not a thing that we are accustomed to doing, but every working person should have one with them and it&amp;#8217;s a great conversation ender. This should also let them know that you plan to follow up with them at some point in the near&amp;nbsp;future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ending&amp;nbsp;Strongly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, endings. My least favorite part of a good song, and quite possibly the most awkward thing to do in a conversation. If you&amp;#8217;re at a networking event, people definitely understand that mingling needs to occur. Oftentimes I say something like &amp;#8220;Well, I&amp;#8217;m going to mingle with the crowd some more, but it was nice meeting you!&amp;#8221; And then after the handshake, make a strong move to walk in the opposite direction. That should limit the awkwardness, while leaving a favorable impression near the end that will allow you&amp;nbsp;to&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow-Up&amp;nbsp;afterwards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely crucial. You have the business card, you&amp;#8217;ve waited a day or so, and now it&amp;#8217;s time for you to follow up with the super interesting contact you just made. Here is where having a professional, current LinkedIn really pays off. Since the interaction is fresh in their minds, you can connect with this person. In addition, I often send a follow up email that gets you in their contact list. If there were any steps that you had to complete (for example, submitting your resume), make sure you submit that immediately and you can have your email look like the&amp;nbsp;following:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Person&amp;#8217;s Name&lt;/em&gt;
It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday at &lt;em&gt;Networking Event&lt;/em&gt;. Hearing from someone in the industry really helped me clarify my thoughts on &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt;. I &lt;em&gt;did the thing&lt;/em&gt; and would love to talk about next steps whenever you have a&amp;nbsp;moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate your time in talking with me. 
Thanks,
&lt;em&gt;Insert&amp;nbsp;name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal here was to make a short cheat sheet for any networking event. Talking to strangers is difficult and it helps to have a plan to approach such interactions with.  Following such a plan can turn a networking event from a maybe into a sure win that leads to new adventures and&amp;nbsp;opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="networking"></category><category term="guides"></category></entry><entry><title>How to get Started with Trading Stocks</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/getting-started-with-trading-stocks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-30T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-08-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2016-08-30:/getting-started-with-trading-stocks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to trade stocks? This will show you&amp;nbsp;how.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;#8217;d like to explain how to get started with trading stocks. I&amp;#8217;ve always been interested in trading stocks, but getting started seemed like such an insurmountable hurdle. In addition, I would like to detail my theories about stock trading, and how I am using those theories to make&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting&amp;nbsp;Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started was actually easier than I thought it would be. The most difficult part was comparing the different stock trading options available and trying to pick the option that would cost me the least amount of money. The service that I landed on was &lt;a href="https://www.robinhood.com" title="Robinhood"&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;, for the simple reason that it lacks the $10 cost per trading transaction that many other services do. A trade without a $10 commission allows me more flexibility in trading, because I don&amp;#8217;t have to make up that $10 in profit. After linking my account&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to Robinhood and transferring some money over, I was ready to make my first trade. But first, I had to figure out my philosophy for&amp;nbsp;investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This initial three month period was a passive attempt at understanding how the market feels to a stock trader. While keeping track of my results, I made no hasty decisions and promptly reaped the fruits of my labor, earning a 15% return in three months. My investing philosophy, while continuing to change and grow currently has four parts:
1. Only invest in areas you know
2. Invest in solid areas that have value, and a high barrier to entry
3. Don&amp;#8217;t make rash judgements. Have a price where you enter, a price where you sell and are happy, as well as a price where you sell if things go south. 
4. Diversify. Don&amp;#8217;t have all of my eggs in one basket, but also be prepared to ride a positive wave, if need&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this theory, I am currently invested in three stocks: Under Armor (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UA&lt;/span&gt;), Twitter (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWTR&lt;/span&gt;) and Advanced Micro Devices (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt;). So far, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt; has been the big winner for me, but I am currently in the green on all three stocks. My thinking for each stock purchase is as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UA&lt;/span&gt;: I wanted a retail company in my portfolio. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UA&lt;/span&gt; has contracts with some of the biggest, youngest names in sports such as Steph Curry and Bryce Harper. In addition, with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NBA&lt;/span&gt; Finals coming up I thought that Under Armor would receive a huge boost to their sales if Golden State won (spoiler: they didn&amp;#8217;t). Overall, I am currently not too thrilled with their performance so far, but I&amp;#8217;m still in a holding&amp;nbsp;pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWTR&lt;/span&gt;: I&amp;#8217;m very much a tech guy, and I think Twitter is highly underrated. Multiple different subcultures have their primary interaction on Twitter (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NBA&lt;/span&gt;, media, etc) and until that goes away, Twitter is still an incredibly valuable company. In addition, Twitter stays on the cutting edge of breaking news stories, and individuals&amp;#8217; Twitter handles are still displayed across television. All that the company requires is the correct vision, but failing that I think an acquisition to the company is increasingly&amp;nbsp;likely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt;: As a student of technological forces, I believe that everything will be connected. What was once dumb will become smart. Secondly, I think that Virtual and Augmented reality are only had going to become more and more common in society. Investing in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt; allows me to take the position of selling supplies to the gold miners, and thus is a good investment for the&amp;nbsp;future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, I now have the tools to trade stocks, and a working theory about how to approach my trades. From here, I&amp;#8217;ll work on maximizing my trade value as well as avoiding costly mistakes. In the next installment, I&amp;#8217;ll focus more on the selling aspect, as well as check up on my&amp;nbsp;progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other step that I did was to make a completely separate bank account, in order to more easily track my gains and losses. However, it is completely feasible to trade with one&amp;#8217;s main bank account information. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
