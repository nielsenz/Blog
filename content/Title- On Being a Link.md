[Great post](https://austinkleon.com/2019/02/21/an-intercourse-with-the-world/) yesterday from Austin Kleon about why he writes. The whole thing is worth reading, but I’m going to pull out one section:

> Karl Lagerfield died this week, and he said: “Books are a hard-bound drug with no danger of an overdose. I am the happy victim of books.” If books are drugs, then maybe my books are just gateway drugs that lead to better ones. I’m more than okay with that!

> But again, what’s the point, here? Why do I even write books in the first place?

> It’s just to join that world that I love. To be a little link in a chain, no matter how puny.

There’s obviously value here in Kleon’s work - his commercial success makes that obvious. But I love how he has a higher raison d’etre; he just looks at other authors and wants to be in that conversation. 

How many people work in a job that really doesn’t contribute any value to the world at large? There’s value and honor to be able to find a higher purpose in what you do (which I’m fortunate to have myself). 

Overall, I think it was a great reminder to be working _consciously_ in a way that find highly refreshing. Well worth the read.
