With all of the fancy tech productivity apps that have come out (Notion, slack, etc) I feel like my life is still stuck in 2011 in a lot of ways. 

As someone who is "good with computers" there isn't a ton of whiz bang technology to keep my daily life focused. 

I do think that's partly due to the fact that I don't have that much to do (by design) but it's something to think about and improve moving forward
