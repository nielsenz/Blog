Summary: Who wouldn't prefer more flexible hours?

One night, several thought occurred to me regarding hiring practices.
1. There is a certain nonzero percentage of people who are not morning people
2. These people are not enjoying the typical 9-5 job. 
3. It stands to reason that if companies want to be competitive in hiring the best talent, companies need ways to distinguish themselves. Shouldn't it be the case that there should be more choices offered regarding job hours, as a way to separate themselves from the pack?

## Why hasn't this occurred?  
It can be self perpetuating.  Because no high value employees have asked for it, no one asks for it. The other option is that the benefits of having everyone there at roughly the same time outweigh the costs of acquiring talent at a lower cost.
  
Because let's be honest, who wouldn't give preference to a position with more flexible hours?
