    <p>Posted on Mon 30 January 2017 in <a href="./category/analysis.html">Analysis</a></p>
  </header>
  <div>
    <p>While going though some old articles I had saved, I found this <a href="https://marco.org/2015/01/15/overcast-sales-numbers" title="overcast sales numbers">post</a> from Marco Arment. For those that are unaware, Arment is an iOS developer and here he both provides his own iOS app sales data and well as linking to other posts with similar data. The data he provides is valuable, and it is worth going through old data to see what lessons we can draw from his real life&nbsp;experience. </p>
<h2>The Data and&nbsp;Conclusions:</h2>
<p>The main conclusion that can be seen is that the first week after launch is when sales are at their peak. This makes sense logically, as marketing and press highest level.<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> In addition, your biggest fans are waiting to purchase whatever you put out.<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>From there begins the difficult task of convincing more indifferent people to try (and buy) your product.<sup id="fnref-3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> This can be seen in <a href="http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/93118460565/a-candid-look-at-unreads-first-year" title="Unread's Sales Numbers">Jared Sinclair&#8217;s post</a> about his app sales at the time<sup id="fnref-4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>, Unread. In his post, he makes the explicit statement that during the first week, &#8220;Demand for your app will likely never be higher&nbsp;again.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Qualifiers and Lessons&nbsp;Learned</h2>
<p>There is more recent data to look at as well, and the lessons it shows are the same. <a href="https://medium.com/@genadyo/my-first-3-months-on-the-imessage-app-store-300044e6a15">Here</a> is an example of an iMessage app, where most of the sales were immediately after the app was launched.<sup id="fnref-5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> Another interesting piece came from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2016/08/vesper_adieu">Daring Fireball</a> on the end of Vesper, a notes app created by John Gruber, Brent Simmons and Dave Wiskus. It was a very interesting piece on what they would do differently. Gruber makes a great point on how luck plays a role in any venture; however, the market for a paid for iOS app is changing as&nbsp;well. </p>
<p>I think the main lesson to learn though comes from <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/pleco-building-business-just-app/">Stratechery,</a> with regards to Sinclair&#8217;s app. Thompson speaks to how the marginal cost for any app is zero; without meaningful differentiation, this implies that the cost of an app will fall to zero. Design for the sake of design won&#8217;t earn you any sales, it is key to have a tangible reason on why someone will buy your&nbsp;app. </p>
<p>Another lesson that was hit repeatedly was how crucial it is to have some sort of recurring revenue. Gruber mentions how they should have created a Mac app and charged for a sync service; many popular apps now follow a similar phenomenon<sup id="fnref-6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>. Enterprise software has leaned towards a <span class="caps">SAAS</span> (software as a service) model for awhile. Some sort of recurring revenue will now be necessary to survive in the market. With prices falling, it becomes unsustainable to sell an app at a fixed&nbsp;price. </p>
<p>Overall, the main lesson is that without meaningful differentiation, price falls to marginal cost. Although the initial tendency to enter into a market may be driven by idealistic standards, it is still crucial to look at a market to determine the viability of entering. With meaningful differentiation though, the opportunities are&nbsp;endless.  </p>
