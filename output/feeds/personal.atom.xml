&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COOK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOUP&lt;/span&gt;
First, you need some water. Fuse two hydrogen with one oxygen and repeat until you have enough. While the water is heating, raise some cattle. Pay a man with grim eyes to do the slaughtering, preferably while you are away. Roast the bones, then add to the water. Go away again. Come back once in awhile to skim. When the bones begin to float, lash together into booms and tow up the coast. Reduce. Keep reducing. When you think you have reduced enough, reduce some more. Raise some barley. When the broth coats the back of a spoon and light cannot escape it, you are nearly there. Pause to mop your brow as you harvest the barley. Search in vain for a cloud in the sky. Soak the barley overnight (you will need more water here), then add to the broth. When, out of the blue, you remember the first person you truly loved, the soup is ready.&amp;nbsp;Serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing like this is a treasure and should be remembered.

I currently have an idea in my head that I want to express in this article; however, during my first draft, maybe 40-60% of that idea is accurately relayed. The rest of it is lost, due to the difficulties in&amp;nbsp;translation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, once I edit this article, I can get that percentage higher and higher. After a couple of revisions, the article begins to approach 95% of the idea I had in my head. So the point of editing isn’t to remove errors,&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it’s to make sure this article perfectly matches the idea in my&amp;nbsp;head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I do have several of those.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In order to always be improving, it’s critical to have a way to check in with past versions of myself, either with this blog or by reading old journal entries. Reviewing these posts let’s me be able to make sure that I am on the right path and therefore are improving as a&amp;nbsp;person.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="writing"></category><category term="blogging"></category><category term="journaling"></category></entry><entry><title>Journaling Versus Blogging</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/journaling-versus-blogging.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-11-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2017-11-03:/journaling-versus-blogging.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a world of weakening privacy, is there value to posting things&amp;nbsp;publicly?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to make a stronger distinction between a private journal versus a public blog. As an example, I have been enjoying &lt;a href="https://with.thegra.in"&gt;With the Grain’s&lt;/a&gt; small discussion on a personal topic per day. This combination of public and private is useful to read; hearing what other people are going through helps put my own life in perspective. With November being the month of &lt;a href="https://nanowrimo.org"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt;, I plan on writing more and seeing what results from&amp;nbsp;that. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="writing"></category><category term="journaling"></category><category term="blogging"></category></entry></feed>
