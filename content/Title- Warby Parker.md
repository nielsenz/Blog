Summary: Warby Parker is showing how AR can be a game changer. 

[The Verge reports](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16619124/warby-parker-iphone-x-app-face-mapping-glasses) that Warby Parker is using Apple’s ARKit to help them size glasses on customers. The process of buying glasses at Warby Parker can be a painful back and forth process and this could help customers more easily visualize how the glasses will look on their faces. In July [I discussed](http://zachnielsen.org/apple-moves-into-ar.html) how Apple’s recently released ARKit could benefit apps on the iOS platform and Warby Parker looks like one of the first companies to put AR into production.
