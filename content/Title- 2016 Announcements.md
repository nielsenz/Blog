Summary: A plan for the near future to figure out the far future. 

My plan is for this blog to be dark the rest of December. While I'm not a huge believer in New Year's Resolutions, I have always used the end of December/early January as a time to reevaluate and make sure I'm on the correct course for the future. 

Have a happy holidays, make sure to pay attention to price discrimination and arbitrage, and we'll see you in 2017.
