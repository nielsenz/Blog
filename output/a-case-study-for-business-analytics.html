    <p>Posted on Wed 30 August 2017 in <a href="/category/analysis.html">Analysis</a></p>

  <div>
    <p>Oftentimes business analytics consists of focusing too much on <em>academic</em> insights rather than <em> practical</em> insights. Throughout this blog I try and stay focused on the practical; one way to do so is by a case study. Below I will lay out an example company that has does not have a data driven decision culture and explain how they can begin using data to make&nbsp;decisions. </p>
<h3>The&nbsp;Setup</h3>
<p>Imagine you are a greeting card company, focusing on luxury greeting cards. The prices are higher than what people are used to paying for a card, but you think the benefits are worth the cost. You have multiple categories of cards, such as birthday and Halloween cards as well as the ability to offer coupons. Currently you have an online store but management is thinking about opening up a retail store and would love insight as to what would be the best location. If I was an analytics manager, where would be the areas that I could apply analytics and immediately see&nbsp;results?</p>
<h3>Stocking&nbsp;Tips</h3>
<p>Well, there are a number of ways. I would first start a customer profile page, where the customer enter in important dates. By being able to track certain dates customers buy cards for, a follow up email can be sent next year for a card of the same type. In other words, if they buy a birthday card on July 29th, it stands to reason a birthday is coming up and that they will want to buy a birthday card the next year as&nbsp;well. </p>
<p>This would also help with making purchasing decisions in the aggregate. If a large majority of birthday sales happen in the summer months, it would make sense to order more birthday cards than usual. This would help keep shipping times low and customer satisfaction&nbsp;high.  </p>
<h3>Bundling</h3>
<p>I would also start to look at bundling different card types together. In Economics, bundling can be used to maximize producer revenue. Here, I would look at pairing cards that are not top sellers with cards that are, or offering a slight discount to those that buy multiple cards in a&nbsp;pack. </p>
<h3>Examining profit margins per&nbsp;card</h3>
<p>I would look at the various profits per card; it stands to reason that if I have a lot of different card types, some cards make more in profit than others. By performing this exercise, the company as a whole can see if expectations match up with&nbsp;reality. </p>
<p>Once we have these profitability numbers for each card, we can examine if all the cards are profitable to begin with. If a certain type of card is not making money, we can examine why that is and if it is acceptable. Maybe one card is sold at a loss, but drives sales of a more expensive card. Or that this card often appears on social media, meaning that this card is more valuable then first&nbsp;anticipated. </p>
<h3>Market Basket&nbsp;Analysis</h3>
<p>Similarly, we could look at market basket analysis of these cards.  In other words, are some types of cards sold together a large part of the time? If so, maybe that can be a discount that we&nbsp;offer. </p>
<p>This would all be groundwork, in order to make sure that all members of the business are on the same page. We could also look at various shipping costs (does it make sense to ship international/various states?) as well as the value of advertising. Finally, we can A/B test various areas of the website as well as different deals to see if sales increase or&nbsp;not. </p>
<h3>Retail&nbsp;expansion</h3>
<p>As far as retail searching, I would first focus on more standard analysis, trying first to answer the following questions: Is there an area with a lower cost to rent? Do we want to have a store in a high traffic (read: more expensive) area in order to boost awareness? How close are similar stores and do similar stores even exist? One useful model would be to use zip code income as a proxy for wealth, and focus on areas that have a high wealth.<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>Elasticity</h3>
<p>Another question that I have is if cost affects sales. If we lower the cost per card by a dollar, does the increase in sales make up for the lost revenue? In economics we would call this an elasticity question, but knowing this answer helps set the optimal price for this good.<sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>We could also look at other factors. Do most of our sales come from a specific part of the country? If so, does weather there affect our sales? Does it make sense to open a store or storage facility there to reduce shipping&nbsp;time?</p>
<p>Overall, we can see that even with a simple retail business, there are a large amount of questions that can be asked and answered by business analytics.I hope this helps show why having a strong grasp on analytics can be crucial for any&nbsp;organization.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>The thinking here is that a luxury card is a <em>normal good</em>, meaning that consumption of this good increases as income increases&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-2">
<p>The rule is that if your good isn&#8217;t a necessity, decreasing the cost increases revenue because the increase in sales overall makes up for the loss of revenue per customer, up to a certain point. If the good is a necessity, such as gas or water, increasing the price increases the revenue because the loss of customers is offset by the additional revenue per customer. &#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
