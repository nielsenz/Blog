The weather has been surprisingly balmy &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I am enjoying all of the new food available to me. &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Now for some articles that I have been&amp;nbsp;reading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://www.marriagekidsandmoney.com/life-after-dave-ramseys-baby-step-7/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; via Twitter, which talks about the best ways to save your money, once you&amp;#8217;ve paid off all of the debt. I am still trying to understand the difference between retirement options, and articles like this help to clarify what the best move&amp;nbsp;is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/iqaluit-amazon-prime-1.4193665"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; talking about the benefits of Amazon Prime to a remote community in Canada. What&amp;#8217;s truly incredible is that Amazon is able to deliver food and other products to a very remote settlement, cheaper than the government. It shows how committed Amazon is to acquiring customers, and how dependanet people are becoming on the internet. It also reminds me of an article I read awhile ago talking about the effects Walmart has when it leaves a&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/you_should_not_force_quit_apps"&gt;John Gruber wrote&lt;/a&gt; a fantastic article talking about why no one should force quit apps on their iPhone. Force quitting an app happens when you double tap the home button and swipe up the apps to make them disappear. Anecdotally, I am seeing this more and more and it’s one of those things that is irritating. I think this may be my Alamo and will start relaying how useless this&amp;nbsp;is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this post &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/24/new-status-symbol-hard-work-spending-ceos"&gt;on work&lt;/a&gt; was a terrific read. Working long hours has become a bragging competition, much to the detriment of workers. I recently found out that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;E.U.&lt;/span&gt; bans working over 45 hours a week which helps remind the workers that they work to live, not live to&amp;nbsp;work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I found &lt;a href="http://www.financialsamurai.com/worst-landlord-horror-story/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; talking about the cons of owning a rental property. I find that in the Financial Independence blogosphere, owning property becomes the de facto way to accumulate wealth; keeping negative case studies in mind can temper that urge to go all&amp;nbsp;in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means it hasn&amp;#8217;t rained in two days and it&amp;#8217;s 70 out.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various meat-flavored chips never fail to make me laugh.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

This is fascinating how you can track Google’s strategy as time progresses. It seems clear that Google is iterating more rapidly than Apple, so I hope that there is something big at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWDC&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second link, I have to &lt;a href="http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/5/24/not-even-wrong-ways-to-dismiss-technology"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to anything Benedict Evans writes. Evans is a very smart guy who thinks a lot about the future. In this piece, he is talking about the urge of people to dismiss new technology. One of my favorite quotes is as follows:
 “William Golding famously said of Hollywood “Nobody knows anything”, but that feels like an abdication of reason and judgement. We should try to do better.”
Yes, we&amp;nbsp;should. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the theme of doing better, a recent study shows that you can become a better performer by &lt;a href="https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/sitting-near-a-high-performer-can-make-you-better-at-your-job"&gt;sitting around other high performers.&lt;/a&gt; Although I was surprised initially, it makes intuitive sense. I’ve always been inspired by other great workers to work harder than&amp;nbsp;before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to draw attention to this great &lt;a href="http://variety.com/2017/film/news/pierce-brosnan-roger-moore-tribute-1202446432/"&gt;tribute to Roger Moore&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed watching his James Bond movies as a kid, and I thought this piece was really well&amp;nbsp;written.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="links"></category><category term="apple"></category><category term="Benedict Evans"></category><category term="performance"></category></entry><entry><title>Four Interesting Links</title><link href="http://zachnielsen.org/four-interesting-links.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-05-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-05-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Zach Nielsen</name></author><id>tag:zachnielsen.org,2017-05-13:/four-interesting-links.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starting a new recurring section to show what I’m currently reading. I find these extremely interesting, and hope they will provide the same level of&amp;nbsp;enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Going through some old articles, I found &lt;a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/06/17/get-rich-with-the-secret-food-stash/"&gt;this great tip&lt;/a&gt; from Mr. Money Mustache. He recommends bringing a mini fridge to work and stocking it with food to always have food available. As someone who is always in a snack-happy mood, I thought this was a great tip and agree&amp;nbsp;wholeheartedly! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little later on he talks about &lt;a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/06/08/the-joy-of-self-employment/"&gt;the joys of self employment&lt;/a&gt;. I thought his view on the matter was super interesting. The concept has always intrigued me, and reading how he got started made it less terrifying in my&amp;nbsp;mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I of course have to plug my &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/znielsen/analysis-and-prediction-of-student-performance"&gt;first post on Kaggle.&lt;/a&gt; For those that are unaware, Kaggle is a data science website. The main draw is the ability for companies to host competitions, meaning that they supply the data and reward the individual(s) who are best able to solve the problem. I took the side route and made my first workbook  predicting student performance. This dataset is not in a competition, I simply wanted to get a feel for the&amp;nbsp;platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last link I have is relating to getting a job in the &lt;a href="http://www.erinshellman.com/crushed-it-landing-a-data-science-job/"&gt;data science field&lt;/a&gt;. I find these types of posts super helpful, as I am going to be soon entering into the job market. It also helps me to know that other people go through the same stress and similar&amp;nbsp;struggles. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="links"></category><category term="kaggle"></category><category term="money tip"></category><category term="self employment"></category><category term="data science"></category></entry></feed>
