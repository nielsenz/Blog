Summary: Never thought soup could be so compelling.

I never knew Dean Allen, or even knew him when he was on the internet, but I saw [this piece](https://web.archive.org/web/20010501174516/http://www.cardigan.com/2001/01-10/) of his that I deeply enjoyed:

> HOW TO COOK SOUP
> First, you need some water. Fuse two hydrogen with one oxygen and repeat until you have enough. While the water is heating, raise some cattle. Pay a man with grim eyes to do the slaughtering, preferably while you are away. Roast the bones, then add to the water. Go away again. Come back once in awhile to skim. When the bones begin to float, lash together into booms and tow up the coast. Reduce. Keep reducing. When you think you have reduced enough, reduce some more. Raise some barley. When the broth coats the back of a spoon and light cannot escape it, you are nearly there. Pause to mop your brow as you harvest the barley. Search in vain for a cloud in the sky. Soak the barley overnight (you will need more water here), then add to the broth. When, out of the blue, you remember the first person you truly loved, the soup is ready. Serve.

Writing like this is a treasure and should be remembered. Safe travels, Dean.
