Quote of the day: "Housing is either a right or an investment." Either the value of it is increasing which precludes some people from having a place to live, or everyone gets access to it. 

Useful in thinking about the incentives, NIMBYism, etc. People don't want houses built next to them, because it lowers the value of their investment.
