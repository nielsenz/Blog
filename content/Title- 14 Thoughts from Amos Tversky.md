Per [The Undoing Project](https://www.amazon.com/Undoing-Project-Friendship-Changed-Minds/dp/0393254593/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1481647965&sr=1-1&keywords=lewis+undoing+project) by Michael Lewis, Amos Tversky (famous for revolutionizing both Psychology and Economics) kept 14 thoughts by his desk. These thoughts will now be on my desk: 

> People predict by making up stories.
> 
> People predict very little and explain everything.
> 
> People live under uncertainty whether they like it or not.
> 
> People believe they can tell the future if they work hard enough.
> 
> People accept any explanation as long as it fits the facts.
> 
> The handwriting was on the wall. It was just the ink that was invisible.
> 
> People often work hard to obtain information they already have and avoid new knowledge.
> 
> Man is a deterministic device thrown into a probabilistic Universe. In this match, surprises are expected.
> 
> Everything that has already happened must have been inevitable.
> 
> A part of good science is to see what everyone else can see but think what no one else has ever said.
> 
> The difference between being very smart and very foolish is often very small.
> 
> So many problems occur when people fail to be obedient when they are supposed to be obedient, and fail to be creative when they are supposed to be creative.
> 
> The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.
> 
> It is sometimes easier to make the world a better place than to prove you have made the world a better place.
