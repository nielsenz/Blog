Like the name suggests, a transaction cost is a cost that is incurred during the transaction. This could be any middlemen in a&amp;nbsp;transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, take buying a car. Before the internet, you didn&amp;#8217;t know what the true price of a car was, which makes negotiation more difficult. In addition, there were only a few local car stores nearby, so the supply of the cars was limited as well. But once the internet came along, services grew up to take advantage of these costs present, such as Kelly Blue Book and Carmax. Both services reduce the friction present in buying a car and transfer some of what used to be transaction costs to themselves.&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If the profits are going to these newly created companies, this means that these profits are not going to the car&amp;nbsp;dealership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One driver of transaction costs is often asymmetrical information. If I&amp;#8217;m a car salesman, I (should) know more about the car than you do. I&amp;#8217;m then able to take advantage of this knowledge in order to squeeze out a slightly higher&amp;nbsp;price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The benefits of the&amp;nbsp;internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet leveled this information advantage. With the iPhone, I now had accessible internet wherever I went. Not sure what the actual cost of a car is? Look it up on Kelly Blue Books. Think the car salesman is being shifty? See how many reviews they have on help. Being able to access information reduced transaction costs and thus increase consumer&amp;nbsp;surplus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lowering of transaction costs can come with unexpected side effects. Take the case of ebooks. When Amazon invented the Kindle and the online bookstore, it was revolutionary because these two interlocking parts removed many of the transaction costs present in publishing a novel. &lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If I had written a novel in the pre-Internet era, I would have to acquire an agent, send my manuscript in to the main publishers and hope it gets picked. In short, the gatekeepers &lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; were removed from the situation. Since those costs disappeared, it became (and now is) cheaper to publish a book. All I had to do was push upload! This increased the the supply for&amp;nbsp;books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who replaces the&amp;nbsp;Gatekeepers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although their role has diminished, these gatekeepers provided a valuable service in making sure these books had a uniform quality. If I was buying a book from Barnes and Noble, I could be pretty sure that there wouldn&amp;#8217;t be any misspellings or incorrect grammar. These publishing houses were taking a risk with each book; by paying an advance they had incentives to make sure I was reading a &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; book. Once these gatekeepers disappeared, the quality of each ebook started to vary wildly. This puts more emphasis on finding &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/forging-hephaestus-book-review.html#forging-hephaestus-book-review"&gt;an author&lt;/a&gt; who consistently puts out good work, but that often doesn&amp;#8217;t last. Browsing the Kindle online store, I now face a higher chance of reading a lower quality book. Ratings help somewhat, but the problem still persists. &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consumers are still better&amp;nbsp;off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I perhaps over exaggerate the dangers involved in finding a poor quality book. &lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This reduction in transaction costs has lead to a dramatic boom in consumer surplus, making everyone better off. Countless individuals have earned a living off of the Kindle store, creating music in the digital age or building iPhone apps. I always want to be aware of the trade offs present; economics is nothing&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These companies were able to undercut the dealerships, taking some of the profits and giving the rest to consumers. Because the consumers end up with more then they had previously, it makes sense for them to use these new services.  &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And later Apple&amp;#8217;s iBooks store and publishing platform.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the same problem in music. Anybody with a mac can now throw something on SoundCloud, but does that mean any of it is good?&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am reminded of a joke regarding &lt;a href="https://medium.com"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, a web publishing service that has done something similar. It&amp;#8217;s called medium because it&amp;#8217;s neither rare nor well done. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We solved it with&amp;nbsp;Economics.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With a holiday to either celebrate one&amp;#8217;s love or corporate consumerism, &lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  I thought it would be fun to try and model the value of surprising a significant other with a gift. Below, you can see the model with a key on the side to demonstrate how to interpret this&amp;nbsp;image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Valentines" src="http://zachnielsen.org/images/Valentines.png" title="Valentine's Day Game Theory"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upper left triangle per box matches the value Person A receives from the action in the respective column, and the lower right triangle matches the action Person B on the left performs. These two people can either surprise or not surprise their partner. I calculated each number using a complex formula&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and I took the overall value to be an average of what you feel towards yourself and your opinion for the other person.&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the square in the top left means that both Person A and Person B surprise each other with a gift. This does not change their self opinion but grows their opinion of the other person by five units. This means that the overall value that they gain from that action is 2.5, which we&amp;#8217;ll use in a&amp;nbsp;minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve talked about &lt;a href="http://zachnielsen.org/a-fivethirtyeight-riddler-attempt.html"&gt;Nash Equilibrium before&lt;/a&gt;, but the main idea is that the game is at equilibrium when each player can&amp;#8217;t make a move to better him or her self, no matter what the other person does. We can find that by limiting one person&amp;#8217;s move and then figuring out what the other player will do in response to that&amp;nbsp;action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, say that Person B surprises Person A with a gift. By covering the bottom row (not surprise) and comparing the numbers in the top left triangle in each column, we can see that Person A receives a higher value when surprising Person B with a gift. Similarly, if we move down a row, we can see that even when Person B doesn&amp;#8217;t surprise Person A with a gift, Person A receives a higher number by surprising Person B (with a value of 1 as opposed to -.5)&lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confusing? Somewhat circular? All true! But by using the same technique to figure out the optimal move for Person B (spoiler: we end up with the same result) it turns out that we do have a Nash Equilibrium that one should always surprise one&amp;#8217;s significant other on Valentine&amp;#8217;s Day.&lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on one&amp;#8217;s point of view&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came up with them as to what felt right. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of these values can be changed depending on what you think is more accurate. Maybe person A and B both rate their self opinion more crucial than their opinion of the other person, in which case the mean can be changed to a weighted mean. Or a -3 can be changed to a -45, etc. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers are called utility values, which are units of happiness. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although what gift to give is another table entirely. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As I&amp;#8217;ve recently been reading about game theory, I thought it would be interesting to work through the problem and see what I come up&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules of the game are as follows: there are two countries with a military strength that is a random uniform number&lt;sup id="fnref-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; between 0 and 1. Each country only knows their strength, and these two countries can choose to either declare war or peace. If either country chooses war, the two countries enter into war with the higher strength country obtaining the wealth of the two countries. If both countries choose peace, then they remain with their wealth. Each country starts with a wealth of 1 trillion dollars. The question now is to solve the game. What is the best move for each&amp;nbsp;country?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting&amp;nbsp;Nashty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first instance of the game is where the moves are made simultaneously&lt;sup id="fnref-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In order to find the &amp;#8220;answer&amp;#8221; to the game, I often pick a strategy and play out the game with that strategy to see what happens&lt;sup id="fnref-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. So assume that Country A chooses to declare war whenever it&amp;#8217;s strength is above .5 &lt;sup id="fnref-4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Because each country is playing the same game, this means that they both follow this rule initially. However, it makes sense for Country B to lower the threshold to .25 (half of the original value). Now you&amp;#8217;re probably wondering how this makes sense. If A&amp;#8217;s strength is above .5, it will always declare war and Country B has to fight no matter what. On the other hand, say A&amp;#8217;s strength is below the .5 threshold. With Country B lowering the threshold necessary to declare war, it will win half of the time and lose half of the time, making a net gain&lt;sup id="fnref-5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! Say Country A also employs an economist well versed in game theory and this economist predicts what Country B will do. Country A will then lower their threshold to .125 (half of .25) for the exact same reason! This arms race will continue until the threshold for each country is at zero, and each country declares war. Thus, the best move&lt;sup id="fnref-6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is to have each country always declare&amp;nbsp;war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the game shifts to a version where Country A acts first, and then Country B acts, not a lot changes. If Country A declares peace, Country B knows that is a sign of weakness and will therefore declare war&lt;sup id="fnref-7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-7"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If the payout of winning the war is increased, all it means is that war will be more valuable and thus will be declared more often as well. Thus, war will always be declared no matter&amp;nbsp;what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In human speak, there&amp;#8217;s a equally random chance it&amp;#8217;ll be any decimal. If the decimals make it tough to understand, just make it any number between 0 and 10.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning that if I&amp;#8217;m Country A, I don&amp;#8217;t know Country B&amp;#8217;s move&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My optimal strategy for solving game theory, if you will.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected utility of declaring war says that it makes sense to declare war whenever the strength of a country is above .5. In other words, the country will declare war when it expects to earn more money from war than from peace. With a strength of .5, the country will be indifferent between war and peace. It earns 1 trillion if peace holds, and it expects to win the war 50% of the time. .5 multiplied by 2 trillion plus .5 multiplied by zero is 1 trillion. &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, we call indifference a win. Makes the math easier.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nash Equilibrium! &amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-6" title="Jump back to footnote 6 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Country A declares war, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter what Country B does regardless.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
