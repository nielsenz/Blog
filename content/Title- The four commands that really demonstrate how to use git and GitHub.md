Summary: After hours of searching for a great git tutorial, this help page demonstrates all one needs to know. 

I’ll have a better post up at some point on how I use git, but [this help page](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) from Github’s docs really does a great job describing the various commands. 

In other news, me finally understanding git is a cause for celebration. I feel like I can now graduate into the ranks of a “true programmer.”
