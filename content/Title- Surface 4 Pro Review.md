Summary: My Surface Pro 4 Review

The Surface Pro has, once the darling of the tech industry, has recently fallen out of favor in the media. I recently had an opportunity to review a Surface Pro, and below I wrote some quick thoughts about my time with it.

## Pros 
- The keyboard was delightful to use. I particularly liked the trackpad. 
- The ability to download full Windows programs was handy. 

## Cons 
- The trackpad, although nice to use, was necessary because Windows is particularly difficult to use with a touch-based interface. 
- The bezels on the machine were particularly thick coming from the world of Apple.
- The screen resolution was particularly odd. This could have been the machine settings, but I felt as though the information density was very low on the machine.  

## Concluding Thoughts 
For a machine that was heralded to be the future of the industry, it seems to have fallen out of the public consciousness. I look forward to the Surface Pro 5 and whether a hardware reversion can address some of the negatives about the machine.
