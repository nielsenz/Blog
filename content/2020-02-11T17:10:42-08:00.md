Really enjoying _When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing by Daniel H. Pink_. It’s enlightening about how bad we are at optimizing our behaviors. Of particular note is the section on napping, which I need to get better at.  

> “Down a cup of coffee. Seriously. The most efficient nap is the nappuccino. The caffeine won’t fully engage in your bloodstream for about twenty-five minutes, so drink up right before you lie down. If you’re not a coffee drinker, search online for an alternative drink that provides about two hundred milligrams of caffeine. (If you avoid caffeine, skip this step. Also reconsider your life choices.)”

Maybe I should start drinking coffee as well!
