Summary:  Editing isn’t just for errors; it’s to make the message more clear.

At the heart of writing is a transfer problem. I currently have an idea in my head that I want to express in this article; however, during my first draft, maybe 40-60% of that idea is accurately relayed. The rest of it is lost, due to the difficulties in translation. 

However, once I edit this article, I can get that percentage higher and higher. After a couple of revisions, the article begins to approach 95% of the idea I had in my head. So the point of editing isn’t to remove errors,[^1] it’s to make sure this article perfectly matches the idea in my head. 

[^1]:	Although I do have several of those.
